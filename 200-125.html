			<strong>OSPF Neighbor Simlet.</strong> &nbsp; Based on <a href="https://www.9tut.com/ospf-neighbor-sim#more-2243" target="_blank">this</a> 9tut question.
		
		<p>
			This <i>simlet</i> is a set of four questions  about basic troubleshooting of an OSPF network. Remember that we are not supposed
			to reconfigure the shown routers in order to solve the issues. We just need to demonstrate that we have figured out 
			what the problems are. In reality, we are answering four multiple choice questions. However, we still have to type 
			some commands on the routers, otherwise we won't get full credit for the answers, even if they are correctly answered.

		<br>
		<p>
			<strong>Note:</strong> &nbsp;
			Type <code>show run</code> on every single router. And run <code>show ip ospf int &lt;<i>interface</i> &gt;</code> on
			the "problematic" interfaces, like on Router4 S1/0, Router3 S1/0, Router3 S1/1, Router5 S1/0. Again, review the posted link above.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Question 1:</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;After typing the <i>show</i> commands, we discover that there's an <i>area</i> mismatch:
			&nbsp; interface S1/0 of R3 is in area 0  while interface s1/0 of R4 is in area 2.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			<strong>Question 2:</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; The ospf hello-interval is different in R3 and R5. It's 50 on R3 and 10 (default value) in R5.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			<strong>Question 3:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; After running <i>show run</i> on R1 and R2, we could see that the hello-interval and dead-interval are different. 
			That's the problem.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			<strong>Question 4:</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;The real problem here is that R6 uses the same router-id of R3 (192.168.3.3) so OSPF neighborship cannot be established.
