Cryptography is the science or study of protecting information, whether in transit or at rest, by
using techniques to render the information unusable to anyone who does not possess the means
to decrypt it. <br>

Plain-text data (something you can read) is turned into cipher-text data (something
you can’t read) by the application of some form of encryption. <br>
 Encrypting data provides
confidentiality because only those with the "key" can see it. <br>

 Integrity can also be provided by
hashing algorithms. <br>
 Nonrepudiation is the means by which a recipient can ensure the identity of
the sender and that neither party can deny having sent or received the message.<br>

Encryption algorithms - mathematical formulas used to encrypt and decrypt data - are highly
specialized and complex. There are two methods in which the algorithms actually work, and
there are two methods by which keys can be used and shared. 
<br>In stream ciphers, bits of data are
encrypted as a continuous stream. In other words, readable bits in their regular pattern are fed
into the cipher and are encrypted one at a time. These work at a high rate of speed.
<br> Block ciphers
combine data bits into blocks and feed them into the cipher. Each block of data, usually 64 bits at
a time, is then encrypted with the key and algorithm. These ciphers are considered simpler, and
slower, than stream ciphers.

</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:500px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">

Symmetric encryption, also known as single key or shared key, simply means one key is used
both to encrypt and to decrypt the data. It is considered fast and strong but poses some significant
weaknesses. It’s a great choice for bulk encryption because of its speed, but key distribution is an
issue because the delivery of the key for the secured channel must be done offline. Additionally,
scalability is a concern because as the network gets larger, the number of keys that must be
generated goes up exponentially. DES, 3DES, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES),
International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA), Twofish, and Rivest Cipher (RC) are
examples.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:500px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">

Asymmetric encryption comes down to this: what the one key encrypts, the other key
decrypts. It’s important to remember the public key is the one used for encryption, whereas the
private key is used for decryption. Either can be used for encryption or decryption within the
pair, but in general remember public = encrypt, private = decrypt. 
<br>
Asymmetric encryption can
provide both confidentiality and nonrepudiation and solves the problems of key distribution and
scalability. The weaknesses include its performance (asymmetric is slower than symmetric,
especially on bulk encryption) and processing power (asymmetric usually requires a much longer
key length, so it’s suitable for smaller amounts of data). Diffie-Hellman, Elliptic Curve
Cryptosystem (ECC), El Gamal, and RSA are examples.

A hashing algorithm is a one-way mathematical function that takes an input and produces a
single number (integer) based on the arrangement of the data bits in the input. It provides a
means to verify the integrity of a piece of data - change a single bit in the arrangement of the
original data, and you’ll get a different response.

</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:500px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
 The attack or effort used against a hashing
algorithm is known as a collision or a collision attack. A collision occurs when two or more files
create the same output, which is not supposed to happen. To protect against collision attacks and
the use of rainbow tables, you can also use a salt, which is a collection of random bits used as a
key in addition to the hashing algorithm. MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3 are examples of hash
algorithms.

Steganography is the practice of concealing a message inside a text, image, audio, or video
file in such a way that only the sender and recipient even know of its existence, let alone the
manner in which to decipher it. Indications of steganography include character positions (in text
files, look for text patterns, unusual blank spaces, and language anomalies) and large file sizes
and color palette faults in image files. Audio and video files require some statistical analysis and
specific tools.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:500px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">

In image steganography, there are three main techniques: least significant bit insertion,
masking and filtering, and algorithmic transformation. Masking hides the data in much the same
way as a watermark on a document; however, it’s accomplished by modifying the luminescence
of image parts. Algorithmic transformation allows steganographers to hide data in the
mathematical functions used in image compression. Tools like OmniHide Pro and Masker do a
good job of sticking messages into the video stream smoothly and easily. DeepSound and
MP3Stego are both tools for audio steganography. Other tools include QuickStego
(quickcrypto.com), gifshuffle and SNOW (darkside.com.au), Steganography Studio
(stegstudio.sourceforge.net), and OpenStego (www.openstego.info).

PKI is a structure designed to verify and authenticate the identity of individuals within the
enterprise taking part in a data exchange. It can consist of hardware, software, and policies that
create, manage, store, distribute, and revoke keys and digital certificates. The system starts at the
top, with a (usually) neutral party known as the certificate authority (CA) that creates and issues
digital certificates. The CA also keeps track of all the certificates within the system and
maintains a certificate revocation list (CRL), used to track which certificates have problems and
which have been revoked. The CA may be internal to begin with, and there could be any number
of subordinate CAs - known as registration authorities (RAs) - to handle things internally (most
root CAs are removed from network access to protect the integrity of the system). In many PKI
systems, an outside entity known as a validation authority (VA) is used to validate certificates - 
usually done via Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). A certificate authority can be set up
to trust a CA in a completely different PKI through something called cross-certification. This
allows both PKI CAs to validate certificates generated from either side.

</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:500px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
CAs work in a trust model. This describes how entities within an enterprise deal with keys,
signatures, and certificates, and there are three basic models. In the web of trust, multiple entities
sign certificates for one another. In other words, users within this system trust each other based
on certificates they receive from other users on the same system. A single authority system has a
CA at the top that creates and issues certificates. Users trust each other based on the CA. The
hierarchical trust system also has a CA at the top (which is known as the root CA) but makes use
of one or more registration authorities (subordinate CAs) underneath it to issue and manage
certificates. This system is the most secure because users can track the certificate back to the root
to ensure authenticity without a single point of failure.

<div style="height:500px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
A digital certificate is an electronic file that is used to verify a user’s identity, providing
nonrepudiation throughout the system. The certificate typically follows the X.509 standard,
which defines what should and should not be in a digital certificate. Version, Serial Number,
Subject, Algorithm ID (or Signature Algorithm), Issuer, Valid From and Valid To, Key Usage,
Subject’s Public Key, and Optional are all fields within a digital certificate.

</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:500px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
A self-signed certificate is one created and signed by the entity internally and never intended
to be used in any other situation or circumstance. Signed certificates generally indicate a CA is
involved and the signature validating the identity of the entity is confirmed via an external source
 - in some instances a validation authority (VA). Signed certificates, as opposed to self-signed
certificates, can be trusted: assuming the CA chain is validated and not corrupted, it’s good
everywhere.

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:500px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">

A digital signature is nothing more than an algorithmic output that is designed to ensure the
authenticity (and integrity) of the sender. FIPS 186-2 specifies that the Digital Signature
Algorithm (DSA) be used in the generation and verification of digital signatures. DSA is a
Federal Information Processing Standard that was proposed by the National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) in August 1991 for use in their Digital Signature Standard
(DSS). The steps in the use of a digital signature include the hashing of the message, with the
result of the hash being encrypted by the sender’s private key. The recipient then decrypts the
hash result using the sender’s public key, verifying the sender’s identity.

Data at rest (DAR) is data that is in a stored state and not currently accessible. Protection of
data on mobile devices from loss or theft while it is in a resting state usually entails full disk
encryption (FDE), where pre-boot authentication (usually an account and password) is necessary
to "unlock" the drive before the system can even boot up. FDE can be software or hardware
based, and can use network-based authentication (Active Directory, for example) and/or local
authentication sources (a local account or locally cached from a network source). Software-based
FDE can even provide central management, making key management and recovery actions much
easier.

<div style="height:500px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">

Tools helpful in encrypting files and folders for other protective services include Microsoft
Encrypted File Systems (EFS), VeraCrypt, AxCrypt, and GNU Privacy Guard. The point is, full
disk encryption may sound like a great idea in the boardroom, but once the drive is unlocked, the
data inside is not protected.

Encrypted communication methods include the following: <br>
*   Secure Shell (SSH) A secured version of Telnet, using TCP port 22, by default, and
relying on public key cryptography for its encryption.<br>
*   Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Encrypts data at the transport layer and above, for secure
communication across the Internet. It uses RSA encryption and digital certificates and can
be used with a wide variety of upper-layer protocols. SSL uses a six-step process for
securing a channel.<br>
*   Transport Layer Security (TLS) Uses an RSA algorithm of 1024 and 2048 bits; TLS is
the successor to SSL.<br>
*   Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) Network layer tunneling protocol that can be used
in two modes: tunnel (entire IP packet encrypted) and transport (data payload encrypted).<br>
*   PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) Used for signing, compression, and encrypting and
decrypting e-mails, files, directories, and even whole disk partitions, mainly in an effort to
increase the security of e-mail communications.<br>

<div style="height:500px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
Heartbleed and POODLE were successful attacks against secure communications. Heartbleed
exploits the heartbeat feature in OpenSSL, which tricks the server into sending 64Kb of data
from its memory.
<br> You can use the nmap command nmap -d --script ssl-heartbleed --scriptargs
vulns.showall -sV [host] to search for the vulnerability: the return will say "State: NOT
VULNERABLE" if you’re good to go. 
<br>The Metasploit auxiliary module openssl_heartbleed can
be used to exploit this. Open SSL versions 1.0.1 and 1.0.1f are vulnerable, and the CVE notation
is CVE-2014-0160.
<br>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:700px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">

POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) took advantage of backwardcompatibility
features in TLS clients, allowing sessions to drop back to the vulnerable SSL 3.0,
which has a design flaw that allows the padding data at the end of a block cipher to be changed
so that the encryption cipher becomes less secure each time it is passed. Defined as "RC4
biases," if the same secret is sent over several sessions, more and more information about it will
leak. Mitigation for POODLE is to not use SSL 3.0 at all. You can implement
TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV (a fake cipher suite advertised in the Client Hello message, which
starts the SSL/TLS handshake) on areas that must remain backward compatible. Another
mitigation is to implement something called "anti-POODLE record splitting." In short, this splits
records into several parts, ensuring none of them can be attacked. However, although this may
frustrate the exploit’s ability to gather data, it also may cause compatibility issues due to
problems in server-side implementations.

<div style="height:500px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">

Cipher attacks fall into a few categories and types. Known plain-text attacks, cipher-text-only
attacks, and replay attacks are examples. Man-in-the-middle is usually listed as a type of attack
by many security professionals and study guides (depending on the test version you get, it may
even be listed as such). Just keep in mind that a man-in-the-middle situation simply means the
attacker has positioned himself between the two communicating entities. Brute force refers to an
attempt to try every possible combination against a target until successful.
