Social engineering is the art of manipulating a person, or a group of people, into providing
information or a service they otherwise would never have given. Social engineers prey on
people's natural desire to help one another, their tendency to listen to authority, and their trust of
offices and entities.

 ECC defines four phases of successful social engineering:<br>
1. Research (dumpster dive, visit websites, tour the company, and so on).<br>
2. Select the victim (identify frustrated employee or other promising targets).<br>
3. Develop a relationship.<br>
4. Exploit the relationship (collect sensitive information).<br>

Social engineering is a nontechnical method of attacking systems, which means it's not
limited to people with technical know-how. EC-Council defines five main reasons and four
factors that allow social engineering to happen.<br>
 Human nature (to trust others), 
    ignorance of
social engineering efforts,
    fear (of consequences of not providing the requested information),
greed (promised gain for providing requested information),
    and a sense of moral obligation are
all reasons people fall victim to social engineering attacks.<br>
    As for the factors that allow these
attacks to succeed, insufficient training, unregulated information (or physical) access, complex
organizational structure, and lack of security policies all play roles.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
All social engineering attacks fall into one of three categories: human based, computer based,
or mobile based. Human-based social engineering uses interaction in conversation or other
circumstances between people to gather useful information.

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
Dumpster diving is digging through the trash for useful information. Although technically a
physical security issue, dumpster diving is covered as a social engineering topic per EC-Council.

<div style="height:450px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
Impersonation is a name given to a huge swath of attack vectors. Basically the social engineer
pretends to be someone or something he or she is not, and that someone or something - like, say,
an employee, a valid user, a repairman, an executive, a help desk person, or an IT security expert
 - is someone or something the target either respects, fears, or trusts. Pretending to be someone
you're not can result in physical access to restricted areas (providing further opportunities for
attacks), not to mention any sensitive information (including the credentials) your target feels
you have a need and right to know. Using a phone during a social engineering effort is known as
"vishing."

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
Shoulder surfing and eavesdropping are other valuable human-based social engineering
methods. An attacker taking part in shoulder surfing simply looks over the shoulder of a user and
watches them log in, access sensitive data, or provide valuable steps in authentication. This can
also be done "long distance," using vision-enhancing devices like telescopes and binoculars.

<div style="height:400px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
Tailgating occurs when an attacker has a fake badge and simply follows an authorized person
through the opened security door. Piggybacking is a little different in that the attacker doesn't
have a badge but asks for someone to let her in anyway. If you see an exam question listing both
tailgating and piggybacking, the difference between the two comes down to the presence of a
fake ID badge (tailgaters have them, piggybackers don't). On questions where they both do not
appear as answers, the two are used interchangeably.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:400px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
Reverse social engineering is when the attacker poses as some form of authority or technical
support and sets up a scenario whereby the user feels he must dial in for support. Potential targets
for social engineering are referred to as "Rebecca" or "Jessica." When you're communicating
with other attackers, the terms can provide information on whom to target - for example,
"Rebecca, the receptionist, was very pleasant and easy to work with." Disgruntled employees
and insider attacks present the greatest risk to an organization.

Computer-based attacks are those attacks carried out with the use of a computer. Attacks
include specially crafted pop-up windows, hoax e-mails, chain letters, instant messaging, spam,
and phishing. Social networking and spoofing sites or access points also belong in the mix.
Most likely the simplest and most common method of computer-based social engineering is
known as phishing. A phishing attack involves crafting an e-mail that appears legitimate but in
fact contains links to fake websites or to download malicious content. Another version of this
attack is known as spear phishing. Whereas a phishing attack usually involves a mass-mailing of
a crafted e-mail in hopes of snagging some unsuspecting reader, spear phishing is a targeted
attack against an individual or a small group of individuals within an organization. Spear
phishing usually is a result of a little reconnaissance work that has churned up some useful
information. Options that can help mitigate against phishing include the Netcraft Toolbar and the
PhishTank Toolbar.

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
Setting up multiple layers of defense, including change-management procedures and strong
authentication measures, is a good start in social engineering mitigation. Other physical and
technical controls can also be set up, but the only real defense against social engineering is user
education.

<div style="height:400px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
Mobile social engineering attacks are those that take advantage of mobile devices - that is,
applications or services in mobile devices - in order to carry out their end goal. ZitMo (ZeuS-inthe-
Mobile) is a piece of malware for Android phones that exploits an already-owned PC to take
control of a phone in order to steal credentials and two-factor codes. EC-Council defines four
categories of mobile-based social engineering attacks: publishing malicious apps, repackaging
legitimate apps, fake security applications, and SMS (per EC-Council, this is known as
"smishing").

Physical security is perhaps one of the most overlooked areas in an overall security program.
Physical security includes the plans, procedures, and steps taken to protect your assets from
deliberate or accidental events that could cause damage or loss. Physical security measures come
down to three major components: physical, technical, and operational. Physical measures include
all the things you can touch, taste, smell, or get shocked by. Technical measures are measures
taken with technology in mind to protect explicitly at the physical level. Operational measures
are the policies and procedures you set up to enforce a security-minded operation. Access
controls are physical measures designed to prevent access to controlled areas. They include
biometric controls, identification/entry cards, door locks, and mantraps.
</div>

<div style="height:400px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
 FRR, FAR, and CER are
important biometric measurements. False rejection rate (FRR) is the percentage of time a
biometric reader will deny access to a legitimate user. The percentage of time that an
unauthorized user is granted access by the system, known as false acceptance rate (FAR), is the
second major factor. These are usually graphed on a chart, and the intercepting mark, known as
crossover error rate (CER), becomes a ranking method to determine how well the system
functions overall.

<div style="height:400px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">

The mantrap, designed as a pure physical access control, provides additional control and
screening at the door or access hallway to the controlled area. In the mantrap, two doors are used
to create a small space to hold a person until appropriate authentication has occurred. The user
enters through the first door, which must shut and lock before the second door can be cleared.
Once inside the enclosed room, which normally has clear walls, the user must authenticate
through some means - biometric, token with PIN, password, and so on - to open the second
door.
