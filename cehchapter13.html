Security assessments can be one of two types: a security audit (vulnerability assessment) or a
penetration test. The security audit scans and tests a system or network for existing
vulnerabilities but does not intentionally exploit any of them. This assessment is designed to
uncover potential security holes in the system and report them to the client for their action. It
does not fix or patch vulnerabilities, nor does it exploit them. It only points them out for the
client's benefit.

A penetration test actively seeks to exploit vulnerabilities encountered on target systems or
networks. This shows the potential consequences of a hacker breaking in through unpatched
vulnerabilities. Penetration tests are carried out by highly skilled individuals according to an
agreement signed before testing begins. This agreement spells out the limitations, constraints,
and liabilities between the organization and the penetration test team.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
Penetration tests consist of two types of assessment: external and internal. An external
assessment analyzes publicly available information and conducts network scanning,
enumeration, and testing from the network perimeterâ€”usually from the Internet. An internal
assessment is performed from within the organization, from various network access points.

Black-box testing occurs when the attacker has no prior knowledge of the infrastructure at all
(your scope is defined, and you'll be provided the minimal amount of information required). This
testing takes the longest to accomplish and simulates a true outside hacker. White-box testing
simulates an internal user who has complete knowledge of the company's infrastructure. Graybox
testing provides limited information on the infrastructure. Sometimes gray-box testing is
born out of a black-box test that determines more knowledge is needed.

Testing can also be further broken down according to the way it is accomplished. Automated
testing uses an all-inclusive toolset. Automated tools can provide plenty of information and many
legitimate results for a lesser price than manual testing with a full test team. However, they are
also susceptible to false positives and false negatives and don't always stop where they're
supposed to (software can't read your agreement contract). Manual testing is the best choice for
security assessment. It requires good planning, design, and scheduling, and it provides the best
benefit to the client. Manual testing is accomplished by a pen test team, following the explicit
guidelines laid out before the assessment.

There are three main phases to a pen test. In the pre-attack phase, reconnaissance and datagathering
efforts are accomplished. Gathering competitive intelligence, identifying network
ranges, checking network filters for open ports, and so on, are all carried out in this phase.
Running whois, DNS enumeration, finding the network IP address range, and network scanning
are all examples of tasks in this phase.

<div style="height:350px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">

Attempting to penetrate the network perimeter, acquire targets, execute attacks, and elevate
privileges are steps taken in the attack phase. Verifying ACLs by crafting packets, checking to
see whether you can use any covert tunnels inside the organization, and using XSS, buffer
overflows, and SQL injections are all examples of tasks performed in this phase. After acquiring
specific targets, you'll move into password cracking and privilege escalation, using a variety of
methods. Finally, once you've gained access, it's time to execute your attack code.

<div style="height:900px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">

The post-attack phase consists of two major steps. The first step involves cleaning up your
testing efforts. Anything that has been uploaded to the organization's systems in the way of files
or folders needs to be removed. Any tools, malware, backdoors, or other attack software loaded
on the client's systems need to be taken off. Any registry changes you've made need to be reset
to their original settings. The goal of this phase is to return everything to the pre-test state.
The second step involves writing the pen test report, due after all testing is complete. The pen
test report should contain the following items:
<br> An executive summary of the organization's overall security posture. (If you're testing
under the auspices of FISMA, DIACAP, HIPAA, or some other standard, this will be
tailored to the standard.)
<br> The names of all participants and the dates of all tests.
<br> A list of findings, usually presented in order of highest risk.
<br> An analysis of each finding and the recommended mitigation steps (if available).
<br> Log files and other evidence from your toolset.
