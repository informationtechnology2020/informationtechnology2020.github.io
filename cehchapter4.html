    <strong>Sniffing and Evasion.</strong>
    
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Sniffing</h2>
  <div>
   <p>
 Sniffing (also known as wiretapping by law enforcement) is the art of capturing packets as they
pass on a wire, or over the airwaves, to review for interesting information. 
</p>
<p>
The process of sniffing comes down to a few items of great importance: what state the network interface card
(NIC) is in, what access medium you are connected to, and what tool you’re running.   
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Sniffers</h2>
  <div>
   <p>
   A sniffer needs your card to run in promiscuous mode. This simply means that, regardless of
address, if the frame is passing on the wire, the NIC will grab it and pull it in for a look. 
    </p>
  </div>



    <h2>Pcap</h2>
  <div>  

 <p>Pcap is needed for your card to effectively slip into promiscuous mode. </p>

 <p>On Windows, the de facto driver/library choice is WinPcap.</p>

 <p>On Linux, it’s libpcap.</p>    
    
  </div>
    
    <h2>Collision Domains.</h2>
  <div>
   
<p>As long as your system is within the same collision domain, right out of the box and without
you changing a thing, your NIC will see every message intended for anyone else in the domain.
</p>
<p>Collision domains are composed of all the machines sharing any given transport medium.
</p>
<p> All systems connected to a hub share the same collision domain. 
</p>
<p>Switches split collision domains so that each system connected to the switch resides in its own little collision domain—the switch
will only send frames down a wire for a given computer only if they’re intended for the recipient.
</p>
<p>If you’re connected to a switch, you receive only those messages intended for your own NIC.
 </p>   
    
  </div>
    
  <h2>Sniffing.</h2>
  <div>
   <p>
There are some important protocols in the upper layers for you to pay attention to in sniffing.
</p>
<p>Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTPv1) was designed to carry an e-mail message. Because it
was written to carry nothing but ASCII, everything sent via SMTP, with no encryption added at
another layer, is sent as clear text. </p>

<p>FTP requires a user ID and password to access the server (usually), but the information is passed in clear text over the wire. </p>

<p>TFTP passes everything in clear text, and you can pull keystrokes from a sniffed Telnet session.</p>

<p>SNMPv1 and NNTP send their passwords and data over clear text, as does IMAP and POP3.</p>
    
    
  </div>
    
     <h2>Address Resolution Protocol.</h2>
  <div>
   
<p>ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) resolves IP addresses to machine (MAC) addresses.</p>

<p>As a frame is being built inside the sending machine, the system sends an ARP_REQUEST to find out
what MAC address inside the subnet can process the message.</p>

<p> The machine on the local subnet with the requested IP will respond with an ARP_REPLY. </p>

<p>The protocol retains a cache on machines as it works, and it works on a broadcast basis. </p>

<p>The cache is dynamic—that is, the information in it doesn’t stay there forever, and when your system gets an updated ARP
message, it will overwrite the cache with the new information. </p>

<p>A<strong> gratuitous ARP</strong> is a special packet that updates the ARP cache of other systems before they even ask for it—in other words,
before they send an ARP_REQUEST.</p>
    
    
  </div> 
    
    <h2>Interception</h2>
  <div>
 
      <p>Lawful interception is the process of legally intercepting communications between two (or
more) parties for surveillance on telecommunications, VoIP (Voice over IP), data, and
multiservice networks. </p>

  <p>Wiretapping (monitoring a phone or Internet conversation) can be active
or passive. </p>

  <p>Active wiretapping involves interjecting something into the communication (traffic),
for whatever reason. Passive only monitors and records the data. </p>

  <p><strong>PRISM</strong> (Planning Tool for
Resource Integration, Synchronization, and Management) is the data tool used to collect foreign
intelligence passing through U.S. network resources.</p>
    
  </div>  
    
    
   <h3>Passive and Active Sniffing</h3>
  <div>
   
<p>EC-Council breaks sniffing down into two main categories: passive and active.</p>
<p> Passive sniffing is exactly what it sounds like: plug in a sniffer and, without any other interaction needed
on your part, start pulling data packets to view at your leisure.</p>
<p> Passive sniffing works only if your machine’s NIC is part of the same collision domain as the targets you want to listen to (and
it’s configured to listen). </p>
<p>Active sniffing requires some additional work on your part, either from
a packet injection or manipulation stance or from forcing network devices to play nicely with
your efforts.</p>
 <p>Active sniffing usually means the collision domain you are part of is segmented
from those you want to look in to (which means you’re probably attached to a switch), and you’ll
have to take proactive steps in order to sniff.</p>    
    
  </div>   
    
    <h3>Active Sniffing</h3>
  <div>
  
 <p>One trick for active sniffing purposes is to get a switch to close the port you are connected to
each and every time it closes the port you want to sniff.</p>
 <p> A span port (also called port mirroring)
is one in which the switch configuration has been altered to send a copy of all frames from one
port, or a succession of ports, to another. </p>

 <p>Another option you have is to fill the content addressable memory (CAM) table, such that the
switch can’t keep up and floods all packets. This process is known as MAC flooding.</p>
 <p> Etherflood
and Macof are examples of tools you can MAC flood with. Switch port stealing refers to the
process of flooding the CAM with unsolicited ARPs regarding specific ports, thus creating a race
condition.</p>
    
    
  </div>  
    
    <h3>ARP Poisoning.</h3>
  <div>
   <p>ARP poisoning is the process of maliciously changing an ARP cache on a machine to inject
faulty entries.</p>
 <p>Most modern switches have built-in defenses for too many ARP broadcasts
coming across the wire (for example, you can configure Dynamic ARP Inspection using DHCP
snooping inside Cisco’s IOS). </p>
<p>Also, administrators can put to use a wide variety of network
monitoring tools, such as XArp, to watch for this, and some network administrators are smart
enough to manually add the default gateway MAC permanently (using the command arp -s) into
the ARP cache on each device. </p>
<p>A couple of tools that make ARP flooding as easy as pressing a
button are Cain and Abel, WinArpAttacker, Ufasoft, and dsniff (a collection of Linux tools that
includes a tool called ARPspoof).</p>
    
    
  </div>  
    
 
  <h3>DHCP Starvation.</h3>
  <div>
 <p>  DHCP starvation is an attack whereby the malicious agent attempts to exhaust all available
addresses from the server. </p>
 <p>Packets in the DHCP exchange include DHCPDISCOVER, DHCP
OFFER, DHCPREQUEST, and DHCPACK. </p>
<p>The packets in DHCPv6 have different names than
those of DHCPv4. DHCPDISCOVER, DHCPOFFER, DHCPREQUEST, and DHCPACK are
known as Solicit, Advertise, Request (or Confirm/Renew), and Reply, respectively. </p>
<p>Tools such
as Yersinia and DHCPstarv can carry out DHCP starvation attacks, and configuring DHCP
snooping on your network device is considered the proper mitigation against this attack. </p>
<p>Another
fun DHCP attack is using a rogue DHCP server. An attacker sets up his own DHCP server on the
network and starts handing out bad IP addresses to legitimate systems connecting to the network.
Whether in conjunction with the DHCP starvation attack or not, this could allow an attacker to
redirect communications sessions.</p>

  </div>
    
    
  <h3>MAC Spoofing, IRDP Spoofing, DNS Poisoning</h3>
  <div>
   <p>MAC spoofing (a.k.a. MAC duplication) is a simple process of figuring out the MAC address
of the system you wish to sniff traffic from and changing your MAC to match it. 
</p>
<p>IRDP ICMP Router Discovery Protocol) spoofing
is an attack where the hacker sends spoofed ICMP Router Discovery Protocol messages through
the network, advertising whatever gateway he wants all the system to start routing messages to.
See this <a href="https://tinyurl.com/irdpdisable" target="_blank">
  "How to disable IRDP" </a> article.
</p>
<p>DNS poisoning is much the same as ARP poisoning, just with DNS entries.
    
    </p>
  </div>    
    
    <h3>Wireshark.</h3>
  <div>
   <p>
    <strong>Wireshark </strong> is probably the most popular sniffer available, can capture packets from wired or
wireless networks, and provides a fairly easy-to-use interface. 
</p>
<p>Wireshark also offers an almost
innumerable array of filters you can apply to any given sniffing session, and you can fine-tune
your results to exactly what you’re looking for.
</p>
<p> Filters are of great use when you set up a packet
capture for a long period of time, and they will show up in bunches on your exam. 
    </p>
  </div>
    

  <h3> I D S</h3>
  <div>
   <p>
Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are hardware and/or software devices that examine streams
of packets for unusual or malicious behavior.  </p>
<p>Sometimes this is done via a signature list, where
the IDS compares packets against a list of known traffic patterns that indicate an attack. 
 When a
match is made, the alarm sounds.</p>
<p> Other IDSs may be anomaly (or behavior) based, making
decisions on alerts based on learned behavior and “normal” patterns—anything out of the
ordinary for a normal day sounds the alarm. </p>
<p>A host-based IDS (also known as
HIDS) is usually a software program that resides on the host itself. A network-based IDS sits on
the network perimeter.
    
    </p>
  </div>
    
    <h3> Snort</h3>
  <div>
   
    
<p>Snort is an open source IDS that is a powerful sniffer as well as a traffic-logging, protocolanalyzing
tool that can detect buffer overflows, port scans, operating system fingerprinting, and
almost every conceivable external attack or probe you can imagine.</p>
<p> <u>Snort runs in three different
modes.</u> </p>
<p><strong>Sniffer mode</strong> is exactly what it sounds like and lets you watch packets in real time as
they come across your network tap. </p>
<p><strong>Packet Logger mode</strong> saves packets to disk for review at a
later time. </p>
<p><strong>Network Intrusion Detection System mode</strong> analyzes network traffic against various
rule sets you pick from, depending on your network’s situation.</p>
    
  </div>  
    
    <h3>Snort Rules</h3>
  <div>
   
    <p>A Snort rule action
can be Alert (in a variety of configured methods, alert when the condition is met), Log (simply
make a note when the condition is met), or Pass (ignore the packet).</p>
<p> Be familiar with the basics
of Snort rule syntax, as well as the raw output from the packet capture. </p>
<p>Pay special attention in
the output to port numbers; most questions can be answered just by knowing what port numbers
go with which protocol and where to find them in the output.</p>
 <p>Also, always watch the directional
arrows in test questions.</p>

     <h3> Firewalls</h3>
  <div>
   <p>
  A firewall is an appliance within a network that is designed to protect internal resources from
unauthorized external access. Firewalls work with a set of rules, explicitly stating what is allowed
to pass from one side of the firewall to the other. Additionally, most firewalls work with an
implicit deny principle, which means if there is not a rule defined to allow the packet to pass, it is
blocked—there is no need to create a rule to deny packets.  
    </p>
  </div>
    
      <h3>Firewalls</h3>
  <div>
   <p>
Originally, firewalls were all packet-filtering firewalls. They basically looked at the headers
of packets coming through a port and decided whether to allow them based on the ACLs
configured.</p>

<p> Stateful inspection firewalls gave the firewall the means to track the entire status of a
connection. ECC also calls these stateful multilayer inspection firewalls, with the capability from
the Network layer up to the Application layer (although their focus is in Layers 3 and 4).

  </div>
    
      <h3>Honeypots</h3>
  <div>
   <p>
    A honeypot is a system set up as a decoy to entice attackers. There are two types of
honeypots.</p>
  <p>A high-interaction honeypot simulates all services and applications and is designed to
be completely compromised.
Examples include Symantec, Decoy Server, and Honeynets.</p>
 <p> A low interaction
honeypot simulates a limited number of services and cannot be compromised
completely (by design). Examples of these include Specter, Honeyd, and KFSensor.
