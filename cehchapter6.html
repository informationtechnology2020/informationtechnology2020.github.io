At its most basic, a web server acts like any other server you already know about; it responds
to requests from clients and provides a file or service in answer. Apache configuration is almost
always done as part of a module within special files (http.conf, for instance, can be used to set
server status), and the modules are appropriately named (mod_negotiation, for instance). Also,
almost everything questioned on IIS configuration is going to come down to privileges, and IIS
itself will spawn all shells as LOCAL_SYSTEM. Apache is built modularly, with a core to hold
all the "magic" and modules to perform a wide variety of functions. Additionally, because of its
open source nature, there is a huge library of publicly available add-ons to support functions and
services.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
Whether it's an Apache or an IIS server, misconfiguration of the settings is the most common
vulnerability that will be exploited. Areas of concern include error messaging, default passwords,
SSL certificates, scripts, remote administrative functions, configuration files, and services on the
machine. Settings such as properly configuring (restricting?) remote administration, eliminating
unnecessary services, and changing any default passwords or accounts are pretty obvious.

An HTML entity is a way of telling the browser to display certain characters it would
otherwise look at as a tag or part of the programming itself. Examples include &nbsp; and &lt;.
HTTP request methods include GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, and CONNECT.
Both POST and GET are client-side ideas that can be manipulated with a web proxy. While GET
is visible in a browser, POST is equally visible within a good-old Wireshark capture. An HTTP
HEAD requests headers and metadata. It works exactly like an HTTP GET, except it doesn't
return any body information to display within your browser. An HTTP GET basically requests
data from a resource. However, HTTP GET can be used to send data as well, and when sending
data, the GET method adds the data to the URL.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
A POST, on the other hand, is a much better method of submitting data to a resource for
processing. It can also be used to elicit a response, but its primary purpose is to provide data for
the server to work with. POST is generally considered safer than GET because it is not stored in
browser history or necessarily in the server logs, and it doesn't display returned data in the URL.
</div>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
There are many attack vectors regarding web servers: password attacks, denial of service, man
in the middle (sniffing), DNS poisoning (a.k.a. hijacking), and phishing. DNS amplification is an
attack manipulating recursive DNS to DoS a target. The bad guy uses a botnet to amplify DNS
answers to the target until it can't do anything else.

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
Directory traversal is one form of attack that's common and successful, at least on older
servers. In this attack, the hacker attempts to access restricted directories and execute commands
outside intended web server directories. Also known as the dot-dot-slash attack, directory
climbing, and backtracking, this attack basically sends HTTP requests asking the server to drop
back to the root directory and give access to other folders.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
 This dot-dot-slash attack is also
known as a variant of Unicode or unvalidated input attack. Unicode is a standard for ensuring
consistent encoding and text representation and can be accepted by servers for malicious
purposes. Unvalidated input means the server has not been configured to accept only specific
input during an HTTP GET, so an attacker can craft the request to ask for command prompts, to
try administrative access passwords, and so on.

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
ECC sometimes likes asking about parameter or URL tampering. In short, this just involves
manipulating parameters within the URL string in hopes of modifying data, such as permissions
and elevation of privileges, prices and quantities of goods, and credentials. The trick is to simply
look at the URL and find parameters you can adjust and re-send.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
Other web attacks covered by ECC are fairly self-explanatory. A misconfiguration attack
takes advantage of configuration items on the server not being configured correctly. A password
attack and an SSH brute-force attack? Exactly what they sound like. Web defacement results in
the page being…well, defaced: an attacker maliciously alters the visual appearance of the page.

Metasploit will cover lots of options for you, including exploitation of known vulnerabilities
and attacking passwords over Telnet, SSH, and HTTP. A basic Metasploit exploit module
consists of five actions: select the exploit you want to use, configure the various options within
the exploit, select a target, select the payload (that is, what you want to execute on the target
machine), and then launch the exploit. The framework base accepts inputs from custom plug-ins,
interfaces (how you interact with the framework), security tools, web services, and modules
(each with its own specific purpose).

Web 2.0 refers to a somewhat different method of creating websites and applications: while
1.0 relies on static HTML, 2.0 uses "dynamic" web pages. Because they're dynamic in nature,
2.0 apps allow users to upload and download to a site simultaneously, which provides much
better infrastructure for social media and other user participation efforts. Per ECC, because Web
2.0 apps provide for more dynamic user participation, they also offer more attack surface.

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
One successful web application attack deals with injecting malicious commands into the input
string. The objective is much like that of the parameter-tampering methods discussed earlier in
this chapter: to pass exploit code to the server through poorly designed input validation in the
application. This can occur using a variety of different methods, including file injection (where
the attacker injects a pointer in the web form input to an exploit hosted on a remote site),
command injection (where the attacker injects commands into the form fields instead of the
expected test entry), and shell injection (where the attacker attempts to gain shell access using
Java or other functions).

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
LDAP injection is an attack that exploits applications that construct LDAP statements based
on user input. In an LDAP injection attack, the attacker changes what's entered into the form
field by adding the characters)(&) after the username and then providing any password.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
SOAP injection is another related attack. Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) is designed
to exchange structured information in web services in computer networks and uses XML to
format information. You can inject malicious query strings (much like SQL injection, as a matter
of fact) that may allow you to bypass authentication and access databases behind the scenes.
SOAP is compatible with HTTP and SMTP, and messages are typically one way in nature.

A buffer overflow attack, also known as smashing the stack, is an attempt to write more data
into an application's prebuilt buffer area in order to overwrite adjacent memory, execute code, or
crash a system (application).

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
Cross-site scripting (XSS) involves injecting a script into a form field intended for something
else. One of the classic attacks of XSS involves getting access to "document .cookie" and
sending it to a remote host.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
A cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is a fun attack that forces an end user to execute
unwanted actions on a web application on which they're currently authenticated. CSRF tricks the
victim into submitting a malicious request. It inherits the identity and privileges of the victim to
perform an undesired function on the victim's behalf.
<br>
 CSRF attacks can be mitigated by
configuring a web server to send random challenge tokens. If every user request includes the
challenge token, it becomes easy to spot illegitimate requests not initiated by the user.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">

A session fixation attack is somewhat similar to CSRF. The attacker logs in to a legitimate
site and pulls a session ID, and then sends an e-mail with a link containing the fixed session ID.
When the user clicks it and logs in to the same legitimate site, the hacker can now log in and run
with the user's credentials.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
A cookie is a small text-based file that is stored on your system for use by the web server the
next time you log in. It can contain information such as authentication details, site preferences,
shopping cart contents, and session details. Cookies are sent in the header of an HTTP response
from a web server and may or may not have an expiration date. The original intent was to
provide a continuous, stable web view for customers and to make things easier for return surfers.

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
SQL injection is, by far, the most common and most successful injection attack technique in
the world. Structured Query Language (SQL) is a computer language designed for managing
data in a relational database system. The relational database is simply a collection of tables
(consisting of rows, which hold individual fields containing data) tied together using some
common field (key) that you can update and query. Each table has a name given to it that is
referenced when you perform queries or updates. SQL comes into play when you are adding,
deleting, moving, updating, or viewing the data in those tables and fields.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
SQL queries generally begin with the SELECT command. SELECT is used to choose the data
you'd like to perform an action on. In addition to SELECT, there are several additional options
and commands of great interest to a hacker. For example, DROP TABLE tablename will delete
the table tablename from the database. INSERT and UPDATE are also easy to understand.
SQL injection occurs when the attacker injects SQL queries directly into the input form.
Properly constructed, the SQL command bypasses the intent of the front end and executes
directly on the SQL database. 
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
To find out whether a site is susceptible to SQL injection, check
your target for a web login page, and instead of entering what's asked for on the web form,
simply try a single quote (') and see what kind of error message, if any, you receive. If that
doesn't work, try entering anything'or 1=1- and see what you get. The attack names and
definitions for SQL are union query, tautology, blind SQL injection, and error-based SQL
injection.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
Another neat little attack is called HTTP response splitting. The attack works by adding
header response data to an input field so the server splits the response in a couple directions. If it
works, the attacker controls the content of the second header, which can be used for any number
of things—like redirecting the user to a malicious site the attacker runs.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
A common method of security testing (hacking) a web application is to simply try using it in a
manner in which it wasn't intended to be used.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
Countermeasures for web server and application attacks include correct placement of the
servers and maintaining a strong patch management effort. Others include turning off
unnecessary services, ports, and protocols; removing outdated, unused accounts and properly
configuring default accounts that must remain; setting up appropriate file and folder permissions
and disabling directory listing as much as possible; and ensuring you have a means to detect
attacks and to respond to them.

Sqlmap, Havij, and sqlninja are all automated scanners designed to look specifically for
injection vulnerabilities. SQLBrute is a tool that allows you to blast through predefined SQL
injection queries against a target. Others tools include Pangolin, SQLExec, Absinthe, and
BobCat.
