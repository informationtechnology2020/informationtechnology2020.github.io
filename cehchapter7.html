In the wireless world, the 802.11 series of standards is very important. 802.11a can attain speeds
up to 54 Mbps and uses the 5 GHz range. 802.11b has speeds of 11 Mbps at 2.4 GHz, and
802.11g is 54 Mbps at 2.4 GHz. 802.11n has speeds over 100 Mbps and uses a variety of ranges
in MIMO format between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. Two other standards of note are 802.11i (an
amendment to the original 802.11 series standard that specifies security mechanisms for use on
the WLAN) and 802.16 (global development of broadband wireless metropolitan area networks,
WiMAX). 802.11an and 802.11ax are next on the horizon.

Modulation - the practice of manipulating properties of a waveform - is the encoding method
of choice in wireless networks. Both orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and
direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) use various pieces of a waveform to carry a signal.
OFDM works with several waveforms, simultaneously carrying messages back and forth: the
transmission media is divided into a series of frequency bands that don't overlap each other, and
each of them can then be used to carry a separate signal. DSSS works differently by combining
all the available waveforms into a single purpose; the entire frequency bandwidth can be used at
once for the delivery of a message.

In ad hoc mode, wireless systems connect directly to other systems, as if a cable were strung
between the two. Infrastructure mode uses an access point (AP) to funnel all wireless
connections through, and clients associate and authenticate to it. Wireless networks can consist
of a single access point or multiple ones, thus creating overlapping cells and allowing a user to
roam freely without losing connectivity. The client needs to associate with an access point first
and then disassociate when it moves to the next one.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
When there is a single access point, its footprint is called a basic service area (BSA).
Communication between this single AP and its clients is known as a basic service set (BSS). If
you extend the range of your network by adding multiple access points, the setup is known as an
extended service set (ESS). As a client moves from one AP in your subnet to another, so long as
everything is configured correctly, it'll disassociate from one AP and (re)associate with another
seamlessly. This movement across multiple APs within a single ESS is known as "roaming."

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
Wireless network design needs to take into account not only the type of antenna used but
where it is placed and what is set up to contain or corral the signal. Physical installation of access
points is a major concern because you will want to avoid spillage of the signal and loss of power.
Most standard APs use an omnidirectional antenna, which means the signal emanates from the
antenna in equal strength 360 degrees from the source. Directional antennas allow you to focus
the signal in a specific direction, which greatly increases signal strength and distance. Other
antennas you can use are dipole and parabolic grid. Dipole antennas have, quite obviously, two
signal "towers" and work omnidirectionally. Parabolic grid antennas work a lot like satellite
dishes and can have phenomenal range (up to 10 miles) but aren't in use much.

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
To identify a wireless network to clients who may be interested in joining, a service set
identifier (SSID) must be assigned. The SSID is not a password and provides no security at all
for your network. It is a text word (32 characters or less) that only distinguishes your wireless
network from others. SSIDs are broadcast by default and are easily obtainable even if you try to
turn off the broadcast (in an effort dubbed "SSID cloaking"). The SSID is part of the header on
every packet, so its discovery by a determined attacker is a given, and securing it is virtually a
moot point.

Wireless authentication can happen in more than a few ways, from the simplistic to the
complicated. There are three main methods: Open System Authentication, Shared Key
Authentication, and Centralized Authentication (for example, RADIUS). In Open System
Authentication, a client can simply send an 802.11 authentication frame with the appropriate
SSID to an AP and have it answer with a verification frame. In Shared Key Authentication, the
client would participate in a challenge/request scenario, with the AP verifying a decrypted "key"
for authentication. And you can even tie the whole thing together with an authentication server
(RADIUS), forcing the client into an even more complicated authentication scenario. Association
is the action of a client connecting to an AP, whereas authentication actually identifies the client
before it can access anything on the network.

WEP stands for Wired Equivalent Privacy and provides weak security for the wireless
network. Using 40-bit to 232-bit keys in an RC4 encryption algorithm, WEP's primary weakness
lies in its reuse of initialization vectors (IVs) - an attacker can simply collect enough packets to
decode the WEP shared key. WEP was never intended to fully protect your data; it was designed
to give people using a wireless network the same level of protection that someone surfing over
an Ethernet wired hub would expect. WEP's initialization vectors are relatively small and, for the
most part, get reused pretty frequently. Additionally, they're sent in clear text as part of the
header. An attacker simply needs to generate enough packets in order to analyze the IVs and
come up with the key used.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
A better choice in encryption technology is Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) or WPA2. WPA
makes use of Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP), a 128-bit key, and the client's MAC
address to accomplish much stronger encryption. The short of it is, WPA changes the key out
(hence the "temporal" part of the name) every 10,000 packets or so, instead of sticking with one
and reusing it. Additionally, the keys are transferred back and forth during an Extensible
Authentication Protocol (EAP) authentication session, which makes use of a four-step handshake
process in proving the client belongs to the AP, and vice versa.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
WPA2 is much the same process; however, it was designed with the government and the
enterprise in mind. In something called WPA2 Enterprise, you can tie EAP or a RADIUS server
into the authentication side of WPA2, allowing you to make use of Kerberos tickets and
additional offerings. WPA2 uses AES for encryption, ensuring FIPS 140-2 compliance. As for
integrity, WPA2 addresses this by using the Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication
Code Protocol (CCMP), with message integrity codes (MICs), in a process called cipher block
chaining message authentication code (CBC-MAC).

An AirPcap dongle is a USB wireless adapter that offers several advantages as well as
software support. WIGLE (http://wigle.net) helps in identifying geographic locations of wireless
networks; teams of hackers have mapped out wireless network locations using GPS and a tool
called NetStumbler. NetStumbler (www.netstumbler.com) can be used for identifying poor
coverage locations within an ESS, detecting interference causes, and finding any rogue access
points in the network. It's Windows based, easy to use, and compatible with 802.11a, b, and g.

Kismet is another wireless discovery option. It works on Linux-based systems and, unlike
NetStumbler, works passively, meaning it detects access points and clients without actually
sending any packets. It can detect access points that have not been configured (and would then
be susceptible to the default out-of-the-box admin password) and will determine which type of
encryption you might be up against. It works by "channel hopping" to discover as many
networks as possible and has the ability to sniff packets and save them to a log file, readable by
Wireshark or tcpdump.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
Another great network discovery tool is NetSurveyor. This free Windows-based tool provides
many of the same features as NetStumbler and Kismet. Additionally, it supports almost all
wireless adapters without any significant additional configuration - which is of great benefit to
hackers who can't afford, or don't have, an AirPcap card. NetSurveyor acts as a great tool for
troubleshooting and verifying optimal installation of wireless networks. A few of the tools
specifically made for wireless sniffing include NetStumbler, Kismet, OmniPeek, AirMagnet
WiFi Analyzer Pro, and WiFi Pilot.

The rogue access point is an easy attack on a wireless network whereby an attacker sets up an
access point near legitimate APs and tricks users into associating and authenticating with it.
Sometimes referred to as an "evil twin," an attack like this is easy to attempt. The use of rogue
APs (evil twins) may also be referenced as a "mis-association attack." Additionally, faking a
well-known hotspot on a rogue AP (for example, McDonald's or Starbucks free Wi-Fi spots) is
referred to as a "honeyspot attack."
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
Denial-of-service efforts are also easy attacks to attempt. In addition to other attacks, you can
jam the wireless signal altogether, using some type of jamming device and, usually, a high-gain
antenna/amplifier. All wireless devices are susceptible to some form of jamming and/or
interference - it's simply a matter of placing enough signal out in the airwaves that the NICs
can't keep up.

Cracking WEP is ridiculously easy and can be done with any number of tools. The idea
revolves around generating enough packets to effectively guess the encryption key. The weak
initialization vectors we discussed already are the key; that is, they're reused and sent in clear
text. Tools for cracking WEP include Cain and Abel and Aircrack (both use Korek, but Aircrack
is faster) as well as KisMAC, WEPCrack, and Elcomsoft's Wireless Security Auditor tool.
KisMAC runs on macOS and can be used to brute-force WEP or WPA. On WEP, Aircrack can
use a dictionary technique, or a variety of weirdly named algorithmic processes called PTW,
FMS, and the Korek technique, while only dictionary can be used against WPA and WPA2.
