When it comes to mobile platforms, there are two major players in the field - Android and
iOS. Android was created by Google specifically for mobile devices, and it contains an OS,
middleware, and a suite of built-in applications for the mobile user. iOS is Apple’s operating
system for mobile devices - that is, the iPhone and iPad (you will also find iOS on Apple TV and
iPods). 
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">


Many of the vulnerabilities and attack vectors we talked about on everything else also apply
to mobile. Perhaps the most obvious attack vector comes from the apps themselves. Others
include social engineering, phishing, and physical security. Android’s Device Administration
API (<a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/admin/device-admin" target="_blank">
    https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/admin/device-admin</a>) provides system-level
device administration that can be used to create "security-aware" apps that may prove useful
within an organization.

BYOD - Bring Your Own Device - allows users to bring their own smartphones and tablets
to the organization’s network. The problem with it is security and control. Mobile Device
Management (MDM), much like Group Policy and such in the Microsoft Windows world, is an
effort to add some control to enterprise mobile devices. MDM helps in pushing security policies,
application deployment, and monitoring of mobile devices. Most MDM solutions offer the same
basic features: passcodes for device unlocking, remote locking, remote wipe, root or jailbreak
detection, policy enforcement, inventory, and monitoring/reporting. Some of the solutions are
XenMobile, IBM MaaS360, AirWatch, and MobiControl.

<div style="height:400px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">

3G, 4G, and Bluetooth are other connectivity means to know. 3G and 4G refer to third- and
fourth-generation mobile telecommunications, respectively, and offer broadband-type speeds for
data usage on mobile devices (cell phones and such). Bluetooth refers to a very open wireless
technology for data exchange over a relatively short range (10 meters or less). Bluetooth devices
are easy to connect one to another and can even be set to look for other devices for you
automatically. Bluetooth devices have two modes: discovery mode and pairing mode. Discovery
mode determines how the device reacts to inquiries from other devices looking to connect, and it
has three actions. The discoverable action obviously has the device answer to all inquiries,
limited discoverable restricts that action, and nondiscoverable tells the device to ignore all
inquiries.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">

Whereas discovery mode details how the device lets others know it’s available, pairing mode
details how the device will react when another Bluetooth system asks to pair with it. There are
basically only two versions: yes, I will pair with you, and no, I will not. Nonpairable rejects
every connection request, whereas pairable accepts all of them.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">

Attacks on mobile devices abound. First and foremost, phishing attacks and social
engineering are merciless when it comes to mobile devices. SMS phishing leverages text
messaging to attack users and devices. The list of Trojans available is almost without end.
Notable Android Trojans include Obad, Fakedefender, TRAMP.A, and ZitMo. Spyware is really
scary, and tools like Mobile Spy and Spyera make it really easy to listen in on or even watch
what the target is doing. Tools like AndroidLost, Find My Phone, and Where’s My Droid were
designed to help users find lost phones, but they (and many, many others) can be used to track
where users happen to be at.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">

The mobile device can also be used as an attack platform. Tools like Network Spoofer allow
you to control how websites appear on a desktop/laptop. DroidSheep allows you to perform
sidejacking by listening to wireless packets and pulling session IDs. Nmap works great on a
mobile device, and sniffers are a dime a dozen. Heck, you can even install Kali Linux on the
thing and turn it into a full-featured hacking machine. NetCut (www.arcai.com/netcut/) claims to
be able to identify all systems on your current Wi-Fi, identify which one you don’t like, and,
with the click of a button, cut them off Wi-Fi.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">

The major Bluetooth attacks are Bluesmacking (denial-of-service attack against the device),
Bluejacking (sending unsolicited messages to, and from, mobile devices), Bluesniffing (effort to
discover Bluetooth-enabled devices - much like war driving in wireless hacking), Bluebugging
(accessing a Bluetooth-enabled device and remotely using its features), Bluesnarfing (theft of
data from a mobile device due to an open connection - such as remaining in discovery mode),
and Blueprinting (footprinting for Bluetooth).

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">

The Internet of Things (IoT) can be defined as a collection of devices using sensors, software,
storage, and electronics to collect, analyze, store, and share data among themselves or to a user.
It refers to a network of devices with IP addresses that have the capability of sensing, collecting,
and sending data to each other - basically a web of connected devices made possible by
machine-to-machine communications, large availability of storage, and internetworked
communications. IoT technologies extend Internet connectivity beyond "standard" devices, such
as desktops, laptops, smartphones, and tablets, to any range of traditionally non-network-enabled
physical devices and everyday objects.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">

IoT architecture comes down to three basic components - things using sensing technology,
IoT gateways, and the cloud (or put another way, data storage availability). A thing inside the
IoT is defined as any device implanted somewhere with the ability (and purpose) of
communicating on the network. Embedded with technology, IoT devices can communicate and
interact over the Internet, and oftentimes can be remotely monitored and controlled. Each of
these things has some form of sensing technology. In other words, sensors are embedded in the
device to measure and forward data.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">

IoT OS examples include RIOT OS, ARM mbed OS, RealSense OS X, Nucleus RTOS,
Brillo, Contiki, Zephyr, Ubuntu Core, Integrity RTOS, and Apache Mynewt. There are four IoT
communication models - device to device, device to gateway, device to cloud, and back-end data
sharing. All work exactly as their names suggest, with only a couple of knowledge nuggets you
can tuck away for test purposes. Device to gateway adds a collective before sending to cloud,
which can be used to offer some security controls, and back-end data sharing is almost exactly
like device to cloud; however, it adds the ability for third parties to collect and use the data.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">

Once a thing has sensed and collected data, it forwards that data to the next component, the
IoT gateway. This is designed to send collected data from devices to the user or to the third
component, data storage or cloud, for use later. The cloud stores and analyzes data, providing
information back for future queries.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
 The Vehicle Ad Hoc Network (VANET) is the
communications network used by our vehicles. It refers to the spontaneous creation of a wireless
network for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) data exchange.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">

In addition to the basic components, EC-Council lists a few architecture layers inside IoT:
Edge Technology Layer, Access Gateway Layer, Internet Layer, Middleware Layer, and
Application Layer. IEEE maintains a journal of all things IoT
(https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6488907), and ITU has a great
collection of news articles about current IoT efforts (https://www.itu.int/en/ITUT/
ssc/resources/Pages/topic-001.aspx).

Here is the OWASP Top 10 for IoT
(https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_IoT_Vulnerabilities):
* I1 -- Insecure Web Interface An insecure web interface can be present when issues such
as account enumeration, lack of account lockout, and weak credentials are present.
* I2 -- Insufficient Authentication/Authorization Authentication may not be sufficient
when weak passwords are used or are poorly protected.
* I3 -- Insecure Network Services Insecure network services may be susceptible to buffer
overflow attacks or attacks that create a denial-of-service condition, leaving the device
inaccessible to the user.
* I4 -- Lack of Transport Encryption/Integrity Verification Lack of transport
encryption allows data to be viewed as it travels over local networks or the Internet.
* I5 -- Privacy Concerns Privacy concerns generated by the collection of personal data in
addition to the lack of proper protection of that data is prevalent.
* I6 -- Insecure Cloud Interface An insecure cloud interface is present when easy-toguess
credentials are used or account enumeration is possible.
* I7 -- Insecure Mobile Interface An insecure mobile interface is present when easy-toguess
credentials are used or account enumeration is possible.
* I8 -- Insufficient Security Configurability Insufficient security configurability is
present when users of the device have limited or no ability to alter its security controls.
* I9 -- Insecure Software/Firmware The lack of ability for a device to be updated
presents a security weakness on its own.
* I10 -- Poor Physical Security Physical security weaknesses are present when an attacker
can disassemble a device to easily access the storage medium and any data stored on that
medium.

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
All previous, and subsequent, attacks mentioned in this book probably have a role in the IoT
world as well. For example, DDoS (distributed denial of service) in IoT isn’t any different from
any other DDoS against or using "normal" devices. In one version of this, noted as the Sybil
attack in EC-Council’s curriculum, multiple forged identities are used to create the illusion of
traffic congestion that affects everyone else in the local IoT network. EC-Council also notes
HVAC attacks in IoT attacks. It’s pretty much exactly what it sounds like - hack IoT devices in
order to shut down air conditioning services.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
A couple other attacks specifically called out are rolling code and BlueBorne. The code used
by your key fob to unlock (and in some cases) start your car is called a rolling (or hopping) code.
An attack can sniff for the first part of the code, jam the key fob, and sniff/copy the second part
on subsequent attempts, allowing the attacker to steal the code - and your car. A BlueBorne
attack is basically an amalgamation of techniques and attacks against known, already existing
Bluetooth vulnerabilities. One of the better ways to pull this one off is to use hardware
specifically designed for it, like the HackRF One (https://greatscottgadgets.com).
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
 Mirai malware
purposefully looks for and interjects itself onto IoT devices. After successful infiltration, it
basically propagates and creates gigantic botnets - with the primary purpose of DDoS attacks
thereafter.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">

The IoT hacking methodology phases are information gathering, vulnerability scanning,
launching attacks, gaining access, and maintaining access. Shodan (https://www.shodan.io/) is
often referred to as the search engine for everything and is a good start in information gathering.
Some other tools to assist in information gathering include Censys (https://censys.io) and
Thingful (www.thingful.net).
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
The second phase in IoT hacking methodology, vulnerability scanning, is exactly as it sounds.
There are several vulnerability scanners and assessment tools for IoT devices, and more are
coming every day. EC-Council lists Nmap as an option. Beyond Trust offer a couple of tools for
IoT scanning, including RIoT Vulnerability Scanner
(https://www.beyondtrust.com/resources/data-sheet/retina-iot-riot-scanner/) and beSTORM
(https://www.beyondsecurity.com/bestorm.html). Some other tools are IoTsploit
(https://iotsploit.com) and IoT Inspector (www.iot-inspector.com).
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
In the launching attacks phase, IoT hacking tools include Firmalyzer (https://firmalyzer.com,
for performing active security assessments on IoT devices), KillerBee (https://github.com),
JTAGulator (www.grandideastudio.com), and Attify Zigbee Framework
(https://www.attify.com, providing a suite of tools for testing Zigbee devices).
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
The last two phases are gaining access and then maintaining access. Telnet is often leveraged
in IoT devices and provides a rather easy means to gain access. Once there you can, of course,
install backdoors, malware, or force firmware updates to ensure you can maintain a presence.
Sniffers for IoT traffic include Foren6 (http://cetic.github.io/foren6/), Z-Wave
(www.suphammer.com), and CloudShark (https://www.cloudshark.org).
