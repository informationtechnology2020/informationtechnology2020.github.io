Virtualization (started back in the 1960s by companies like General Electric, Bell Labs, and
IBM) is a practice whereby the physical aspects of the hardware are virtually presented to
operating systems in a way that allows more than one virtual machine (with their own operating
systems) to run simultaneously on the same physical box.

Cloud computing provides user and
enterprise subscribers on-demand delivery of various IT services as a metered service over a
network. Cloud computing offers everything from on-demand self-service, storage, and resource
pooling to elasticity, automation in management, and broad network access.

 To further define
what exactly it is, we need to consider the three major types of cloud computing - IaaS, PaaS,
and SaaS. Cloud computing can be thought of as the ultimate in separation of duties. It moves
system services that would otherwise be hosted internally to an external provider. It also
separates the role of data owner from the role of data custodian.

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) basically provides virtualized computing resources over the
Internet. A third-party provider hosts infrastructure components, applications, and services on
behalf of its subscribers, with a hypervisor (such as VMware, Oracle VirtualBox, Xen, or KVM)
running the virtual machines as guests. IaaS is a good choice not just for day-to-day
infrastructure service, but also for temporary or experimental workloads that may change
unexpectedly. IaaS subscribers typically pay on a per-use basis (within a certain timeframe, for
instance, or sometimes by the amount of virtual machine space used).

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">
Platform as a Service (PaaS) is geared toward software development, as it provides a
development platform that allows subscribers to develop applications without building the
infrastructure it would normally take to develop and launch software. Hardware and software are
hosted by the provider on its own infrastructure so customers do not have to install or build
homegrown hardware and software for development work. PaaS doesn't usually replace an
organization's actual infrastructure; instead, it just offers key services the organization may not
have onsite.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">

Software as a Service (SaaS) is simply a software distribution model - the provider offers ondemand
applications to subscribers over the Internet. SaaS benefits include easier administration,
automated patch management, compatibility, and version control.

Along with the types of cloud, there are four main deployment models: public, private,
community, and hybrid. A public cloud model is one where services are provided over a network
that is open for public use (like the Internet). A private cloud model is, not surprisingly, private
in nature. The cloud is operated solely for a single organization (a.k.a. single-tenant
environment) and is usually not a pay-as-you-go operation. A community cloud model is one
where the infrastructure is shared by several organizations, usually with the same policy and
compliance considerations. A hybrid cloud model is exactly what it sounds like - a composition
of two or more cloud deployment models.

NIST (National Institutes of Standards and Technology) released Special Publication 500-
292: NIST Cloud Computing Reference Architecture to provide a "fundamental reference point
to describe an overall framework that can be used government wide." This publication defined
five major roles within a cloud architecture: cloud carrier (the organization that has the
responsibility of transferring the data; that is, the intermediary for connectivity and transport
between subscriber and provider), cloud consumer (the individual or organization that acquires
and uses cloud products and services), cloud provider (the purveyor of products and services),
cloud broker (acts to manage use, performance, and delivery of cloud services, as well as the
relationships between providers and subscribers), and cloud auditor (an independent assessor of
cloud service and security controls).

FedRAMP is probably the most recognized and referenced regulatory effort regarding cloud
computing. The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is a
government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment,
authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. FedRAMP not only
provides an auditable framework for ensuring basic security controls for any government cloud
effort, but also offers weekly tips for security and configuration and even has free training
available on the site.

 PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) Cloud Special Interest Group's
Cloud Computing Guidelines also provides notables assistance and information for the cloud.
The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) is the leading professional organization devoted to
promoting cloud security best practices and organizing cloud security professionals. In addition
to providing a certification on cloud security and offering an array of cloud-centric training, they
published a general cloud enterprise architecture model to help professionals conceptualize the
components of a successful cloud implementation. They also publish documentation on
everything from privacy concerns to security controls, focus, and implementation.

Cloud security is really talking about two sides of the same coin - you must be concerned
with the security of the provider as well as that of the subscriber. Both the provider and
subscriber are responsible for security. Using virtualization introduces a hypervisor layer
between the physical hardware and subscribed servers. Therefore, if you comprise the
hypervisor, you compromise them all.

The Trusted Computing Model refers to an attempt to resolve computer security problems
through hardware enhancements and associated software modifications. The Trusted Computing
Group (TCG) is made up of a bunch of hardware and software providers who cooperate to come
up with specific plans. Roots of Trust (RoT) is a set of functions within the Trusted Computing
Model that are always trusted by the computer's operating system (OS).

Tools to assist in cloud security include CloudInspect and CloudPassage Halo. Core's
CloudInspect is "a tool that profits from the Core Impact & Core Insight technologies to offer
penetration-testing as a service from Amazon Web Services for EC2 users." It's designed for
AWS cloud subscribers and runs as an automated, all-in-one testing suite specifically for your
cloud subscription. CloudPassage's Halo "provides instant visibility and continuous protection
for servers in any combination of data centers, private clouds and public clouds. The Halo
platform is delivered as a service, so it deploys in minutes and scales on-demand. Halo uses
minimal system resources, so layered security can be deployed where it counts, right at every
workload - servers, instances and containers." Other cloud-specific tools and toolsets mentioned
include Dell Cloud Manager, Qualys Cloud Suite, Trend Micro's Instant-On Cloud Security, and
Panda Cloud Office Protection.

Cloud Security Alliance released a publication titled "The Dirty Dozen: 12 Top Cloud
Security Threats" (also referred to as "The Treacherous 12") and EC-Council has its own list of
top threats. Important ones to remember include:
* Data breach or loss The malicious theft, erasure, or modification of almost anything in
the cloud you can think of. While cloud providers deploy their own tools, methods, and
controls to protect their overall environment, it's generally and ultimately up to the
subscribers themselves to protect their own data in the cloud. CSA recommends
multifactor authentication and encryption as protection against data breaches.
* Abuse of cloud resources If attackers can create anonymous access to cloud services,
they could then leverage the tremendous resources to do whatever they want. Typically
this threat isn't necessarily a specific concern of cloud subscribers, but it's a very valid
concern for the provider. The provider should perform active monitoring to detect any
abuse instances as well as have a means to protect/recover from them. Generally
speaking, threats of abuse of cloud services apply to the IaaS and PaaS models.
* Insecure interfaces and APIs Cloud services rely heavily on APIs and web services to
function and operate, and without them, functions like auto-scaling, authentication,
authorization, and sometimes the operations of cloud applications themselves will fail.
Insecure interfaces and APIs can circumvent user-defined policies and really mess around
with input data verification efforts. Both provider and subscriber should ensure strong
security controls are in place, such as strong encryption and authorization access to APIs
and connectivity. This threat applies to all models of cloud.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">

Other threats mentioned that warrant inclusion in our discussion are insufficient due diligence
(for example, moving an application from one cloud environment to another and not knowing the
security differences between the two), shared technology issues (multitenant environments may
not provide proper isolation between systems and applications), and unknown risk profiles
(subscribers simply do not know exactly what security provisions are made in the background of
and by the provider). Many others, such as malicious insiders, inadequate design, and DDoS are
valid for both cloud services and traditional data centers.

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is an API that makes it easier for application
components to cooperate and exchange information on systems connected over a network. A
wrapping attack occurs when a SOAP message is intercepted and the data in the envelope is
changed and then sent/replayed.
</div>

<div class="parallax"></div> <br>

<div style="height:300px;background-color:white;font-size:36px">

In addition to every other attack mentioned previously in this book, two that ECC mentions
explicitly are session riding and side channel attacks. Session riding is simply CSRF under a
different name and deals with cloud services instead of traditional data centers. Side channel
attacks, also known as a cross-guest VM breach, deal with the virtualization itself: if an attacker
can somehow gain control of an existing VM (or place his own) on the same physical host as the
target, he may be able to attempt a litany of attacks and efforts.
