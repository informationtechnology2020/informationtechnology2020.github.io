<ol>
<li><h3> A protocol is a set of rules that dictates how computers communicate over networks. </h3></li>
<li><h3> The application layer, layer 7, has services and protocols required by the user's
applications for networking functionality.</h3></li>
<li><h3> The presentation layer, layer 6, formats data into a standardized format and deals
with the syntax of the data, not the meaning.</h3></li>
<li><h3> The session layer, layer 5, sets up, maintains, and breaks down the dialog (session)
between two applications. It controls the dialog organization and synchronization.</h3></li>
<li><h3> The transport layer, layer 4, provides end-to-end transmissions.</h3></li>
<li><h3> The network layer, layer 3, provides routing, addressing, and fragmentation of
packets. This layer can determine alternative routes to avoid network congestion.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Routers work at the network layer, layer 3.</h3></li>
<li><h3> The data link layer, layer 2, prepares data for the network medium by framing it.
This is where the different LAN and WAN technologies work.</h3></li>
<li><h3> The physical layer, layer 1, provides physical connections for transmission and
performs the electrical encoding of data. This layer transforms bits to electrical
signals.</h3></li>
<li><h3> TCP/IP is a suite of protocols that is the de facto standard for transmitting data
across the Internet. TCP is a reliable, connection-oriented protocol, while IP is an
unreliable, connectionless protocol.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Data is encapsulated as it travels down the network stack on the source computer,
and the process is reversed on the destination computer. During encapsulation, each
layer adds its own information so the corresponding layer on the destination
computer knows how to process the data.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Two main protocols at the transport layer are TCP and UDP.</h3></li>
<li><h3> UDP is a connectionless protocol that does not send or receive acknowledgments
when a datagram is received. It does not ensure data arrives at its destination. It
provides "best-effort" delivery.</h3></li>
<li><h3> TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that sends and receives acknowledgments. It
ensures data arrives at the destination.</h3></li>
<li><h3> ARP translates the IP address into a MAC address (physical Ethernet address), while
RARP translates a MAC address into an IP address.</h3></li>
<li><h3> ICMP works at the network layer and informs hosts, routers, and devices of network
or computer problems. It is the major component of the ping utility.</h3></li>

<li><h3> DNS resolves hostnames into IP addresses and has distributed databases all over the
Internet to provide name resolution.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Altering an ARP table so an IP address is mapped to a different MAC address is called
ARP poisoning and can redirect traffic to an attacker's computer or an unattended
system.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Packet filtering (screening routers) is accomplished by ACLs and is a first-generation
firewall. Traffic can be filtered by addresses, ports, and protocol types.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Tunneling protocols move frames from one network to another by placing them
inside of routable encapsulated frames.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Packet filtering provides application independence, high performance, and scalability,
but it provides low security and no protection above the network layer.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Dual-homed firewalls can be bypassed if the operating system does not have packet
forwarding or routing disabled.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Firewalls that use proxies transfer an isolated copy of each approved packet from one
network to another network.</h3></li>
<li><h3> An application proxy requires a proxy for each approved service and can understand
and make access decisions on the protocols used and the commands within those
protocols.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Circuit-level firewalls also use proxies but at a lower layer. Circuit-level firewalls do
not look as deep within the packet as application proxies do.</h3></li>
<li><h3> A proxy firewall is the middleman in communication. It does not allow anyone to
connect directly to a protected host within the internal network. Proxy firewalls are
second-generation firewalls.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Application proxy firewalls provide high security and have full application-layer
awareness, but they can have poor performance, limited application support, and
poor scalability.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Stateful inspection keeps track of each communication session. It must maintain a
state table that contains data about each connection. It is a third-generation firewall.</h3></li>
<li><h3> VPN can use PPTP, L2TP, TLS, or IPSec as tunneling protocols.</h3></li>
<li><h3> PPTP works at the data link layer and can only handle one connection. IPSec works
at the network layer and can handle multiple tunnels at the same time.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Dedicated links are usually the most expensive type of WAN connectivity method
because the fee is based on the distance between the two destinations rather than on
the amount of bandwidth used. T1 and T3 are examples of dedicated links.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Frame relay and X.25 are packet-switched WAN technologies that use virtual circuits
instead of dedicated ones.</h3></li>
<li><h3> A switch in star topologies serves as the central meeting place for all cables from
computers and devices.</h3></li>
<li><h3> A switch is a device with combined repeater and bridge technology. It works at the
data link layer and understands MAC addresses.</h3></li>

<li><h3> Routers link two or more network segments, where each segment can function as an
independent network. A router works at the network layer, works with IP addresses,
and has more network knowledge than bridges, switches, or repeaters.</h3></li>
<li><h3> A bridge filters by MAC addresses and forwards broadcast traffic. A router filters by
IP addresses and does not forward broadcast traffic.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Layer 3 switching combines switching and routing technology.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Attenuation is the loss of signal strength when a cable exceeds its maximum length.</h3></li>
<li><h3> STP and UTP are twisted-pair cabling types that are the most popular, cheapest, and
easiest to work with. However, they are the easiest to tap into, have crosstalk issues,
and are vulnerable to EMI and RFI.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Fiber-optic cabling carries data as light waves, is expensive, can transmit data at high
speeds, is difficult to tap into, and is resistant to EMI and RFI. If security is extremely
important, fiber-optic cabling should be used.</h3></li>
<li><h3> ATM transfers data in fixed cells, is a WAN technology, and transmits data at very
high rates. It supports voice, data, and video applications.</h3></li>
<li><h3> FDDI is a LAN and MAN technology, usually used for backbones, that uses tokenpassing
technology and has redundant rings in case the primary ring goes down.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Token Ring, 802.5, is an older LAN implementation that uses a token-passing
technology.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Ethernet uses CSMA/CD, which means all computers compete for the shared
network cable, listen to learn when they can transmit data, and are susceptible to data
collisions.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Circuit-switching technologies set up a circuit that will be used during a data
transmission session. Packet-switching technologies do not set up circuits—instead,
packets can travel along many different routes to arrive at the same destination.</h3></li>
<li><h3> ISDN has a BRI rate that uses two B channels and one D channel, and a PRI rate
that uses up to 23 B channels and one D channel. They support voice, data, and
video.</h3></li>
<li><h3> PPP is an encapsulation protocol for telecommunication connections. It replaced
SLIP and is ideal for connecting different types of devices over serial lines.</h3></li>
<li><h3> PAP sends credentials in cleartext, and CHAP authenticates using a
challenge/response mechanism and therefore does not send passwords over the
network.</h3></li>
<li><h3> SOCKS is a proxy-based firewall solution. It is a circuit-based proxy firewall and does
not use application-based proxies.</h3></li>
<li><h3> IPSec tunnel mode protects the payload and header information of a packet, while
IPSec transport mode protects only the payload.</h3></li>
<li><h3> A screened-host firewall lies between the perimeter router and the LAN, and a
screened subnet is a DMZ created by two physical firewalls.</h3></li>
<li><h3> NAT is used when companies do not want systems to know internal hosts' addresses,
and it enables companies to use private, nonroutable IP addresses.</h3></li>

<li><h3> The 802.15 standard outlines wireless personal area network (WPAN) technologies,
and 802.16 addresses wireless MAN technologies.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Environments can be segmented into different WLANs by using different SSIDs.</h3></li>
<li><h3> The 802.11b standard works in the 2.4-GHz range at 11 Mbps, and 802.11a works
in the 5-GHz range at 54 Mbps.</h3></li>
<li><h3> IPv4 uses 32 bits for its addresses, whereas IPv6 uses 128 bits; thus, IPv6 provides
more possible addresses with which to work.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Subnetting allows large IP ranges to be divided into smaller, logical, and easier-tomaintain
network segments.</h3></li>
<li><h3> SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) is a signaling protocol widely used for VoIP
communications sessions.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Open relay is an SMTP server that is configured in such a way that it can transmit email
messages from any source to any destination.</h3></li>
<li><h3> SNMP uses agents and managers. Agents collect and maintain device-oriented data,
which is held in management information bases. Managers poll the agents using
community string values for authentication purposes.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Three main types of multiplexing are statistical time division, frequency division, and
wave division.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) provides a standardized packet format for
delivering audio and video over IP networks. It works with RTP Control Protocol,
which provides out-of-band statistics and control information to provide feedback on
QoS levels.</h3></li>
<li><h3> 802.1AR provides a unique ID for a device. 802.1AE provides data encryption,
integrity, and origin authentication functionality at the data link level. 802.1AF
carries out key agreement functions for the session keys used for data encryption.
Each of these standards provides specific parameters to work within an 802.1X EAPTLS
framework.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Lightweight EAP was developed by Cisco and was the first implementation of EAP
and 802.1X for wireless networks. It uses preshared keys and MS-CHAP to
authenticate client and server to each other.</h3></li>
<li><h3> In EAP-TLS the client and server authenticate to each other using digital certificates.
The client generates a pre-master secret key by encrypting a random number with the
server's public key and sends it to the server.</h3></li>
<li><h3> EAP-TTLS is similar to EAP-TLS, but only the server must use a digital certification
for authentication to the client. The client can use any other EAP authentication
method or legacy PAP or CHAP methods.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Network convergence means the combining of server, storage, and network
capabilities into a single framework.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Mobile telephony has gone through different generations and multiple access
technologies: 1G (FDMA), 2G (TDMA), 3G (CDMA), and 4G (OFDM).</h3></li>
<li><h3> Link encryption is limited to two directly connected devices, so the message must be
decrypted (and potentially re-encrypted) at each hop.</h3></li>
<li><h3> The Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol is an example of a link encryption
technology.</h3></li>
<li><h3> End-to-end encryption involves the source and destination nodes, so the message is
not decrypted by intermediate nodes.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Transport Layer Security (TLS) is an example of an end-to-end encryption
technology.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) is a technical specification
indicating how multimedia data and e-mail binary attachments are to be transferred.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Secure MIME (S/MIME) is a standard for encrypting and digitally signing e-mail
and for providing secure data transmissions using public key infrastructure (PKI).</h3></li>
<li><h3> Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is a freeware e-mail security program that uses PKI based
on a web of trust.</h3></li>
<li><h3> S/MIME and PGP are incompatible because the former uses centralized, hierarchical
Certificate Authorities (CAs) while the latter uses a distributed web of trust.</h3></li>
<li><h3> HTTP Secure (HTTPS) is HTTP running over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or
Transport Layer Security (TLS).</h3></li>
<li><h3> SSL was formally deprecated in June of 2015.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Cookies are text files that a browser maintains on a user's hard drive or memory
segment in order to remember the user or maintain the state of a web application.</h3></li>
<li><h3> Secure Shell (SSH) functions as a type of tunneling mechanism that provides
terminal-like access to remote computers.</h3></li>
<li><h3> A denial-of-service (DoS) attack results in a service or resource being degraded or
made unavailable to legitimate users.</h3></li>
<li><h3> DNS hijacking is an attack that forces the victim to use a malicious DNS server
instead of the legitimate one.</h3></li>
