<li><h3> An audit is a systematic assessment of the security controls of an information system.
</h3></li><li><h3> Setting a clear set of goals is probably the most important step of planning a security
audit.
</h3></li><li><h3> Internal audits benefit from the auditors' familiarity with the systems, but may be
hindered by a lack of exposure to how others attack and defend systems.
</h3></li><li><h3> External audits happen when organizations have a contract in place that includes
security provisions. The contracting party can demand to audit the contractor to
ensure those provisions are being met.
</h3></li><li><h3> Third-party audits typically bring a much broader background of experience that can
provide fresh insights, but can be expensive.
</h3></li><li><h3> Test coverage is a measure of how much of a system is examined by a specific test (or
group of tests).
</h3></li><li><h3> A vulnerability test is an examination of a system for the purpose of identifying,
defining, and ranking its vulnerabilities.
</h3></li><li><h3> Black box testing treats the system being tested as completely opaque.
</h3></li><li><h3> White box testing affords the auditor complete knowledge of the inner workings of
the system even before the first scan is performed.
</h3></li><li><h3> Gray box testing gives the auditor some, but not all, information about the internal
workings of the system.

</h3></li><li><h3> Penetration testing is the process of simulating attacks on a network and its systems at
the request of the owner.
</h3></li><li><h3> A blind test is one in which the assessors only have publicly available data to work
with and the network security staff is aware that the testing will occur.
</h3></li><li><h3> A double-blind test (stealth assessment) is a blind test in which the network security
staff is not notified that testing will occur.
</h3></li><li><h3> War dialing allows attackers and administrators to dial large blocks of phone numbers
in search of available modems.
</h3></li><li><h3> A log review is the examination of system log files to detect security events or to verify
the effectiveness of security controls.
</h3></li><li><h3> Synthetic transactions are scripted events that mimic the behaviors of real users and
allow security professionals to systematically test the performance of critical services.
</h3></li><li><h3> A misuse case is a use case that includes threat actors and the tasks they want to
perform on the system.
</h3></li><li><h3> A code review is a systematic examination of the instructions that comprise a piece of
software, performed by someone other than the author of that code.
</h3></li><li><h3> Interface testing is the systematic evaluation of a given set of exchange points for data
between systems and/or users.
</h3></li><li><h3> Administrative controls are implemented primarily through policies or procedures.
</h3></li><li><h3> Privileged user accounts pose significant risk to the organization and should be
carefully managed and controlled.
</h3></li><li><h3> User accounts should be promptly suspended whenever the user departs the
organization permanently or for an extended period.
</h3></li><li><h3> Data backups should not be considered reliable unless they have been verified to be
usable to restore data.
</h3></li><li><h3> A business continuity plan (BCP) ensures that the critical business processes of an
organization remain uninterrupted or are quickly restored after a serious event.
</h3></li><li><h3> A disaster recovery plan (DRP) ensures that the information systems supporting
critical business processes remain operational or are quickly restored in the event of a
disaster.
</h3></li><li><h3> The BCP and DRP both need to be evaluated regularly to ensure they remain
effective in the face of environmental changes in and around the organization.
</h3></li><li><h3> Security training is the process of teaching a skill or set of skills that will allow people
to better perform specific functions.
</h3></li><li><h3> Security awareness training is the process of exposing people to security issues so that
they may be able to recognize them and better respond to them.
</h3></li><li><h3> Social engineering, in the context of information security, is the process of
manipulating individuals so that they perform actions that violate security protocols.
</h3></li><li><h3> Phishing is social engineering conducted through a digital communication.
</h3></li><li><h3> A drive-by download is an automatic attack that is triggered simply by visiting a
malicious website.
</h3></li><li><h3> Key performance indicators (KPIs) measure the effectiveness of an organization in
performing a given task at a given point in time.
</h3></li><li><h3> Key risk indicators (KRIs) measure the risk inherent in performing a given action or
set of actions.
</h3></li><li><h3> Reports must be written with a specific audience in mind if they are to be effective.
</h3></li><li><h3> A management review is a formal meeting in which senior organizational leaders
determine whether the information security management systems are effectively
accomplishing their goals.</h3></li>
