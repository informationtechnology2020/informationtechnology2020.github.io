<h3> There will be several instances
somewhere along your study and eventual exam life where you will say, aloud, "That's
not what happens in the real world! Anyone claiming that would be stuffed in a locker and
sprayed head to toe with shaving cream!" Trust me when I say this: real life and a
certification exam are not necessarily always directly proportional. On some of these
questions, you'll need to study and learn what you need for the exam, knowing full well
it's different in the real world. If you don't know what I mean by this, ask someone who
has been doing this for a while if they think social engineering is passive.</h3><br>
<h3> Go to the bathroom before you enter your test room. Even if you don't have to. Because,
trust me, you do.</h3><br>
<h3> Use time to your advantage. The exam now is split into sections, with a timeframe set up
for each one. You can work and review inside the section all you want, but once you pass
through it you can't go back. And if you fly through a section, you don't get more time on
the next one. Take your time and review appropriately.</h3><br>
<h3> Make use of the paper and pencil/pen the friendly test proctor provides you. As soon as
you sit down, before you click START on the ominous test monitor display, start writing
down everything from your head onto the paper provided. I would recommend reviewing
just before you walk into the test center those sections of information you're having the
most trouble remembering. When you get to your test room, write them down
immediately. That way, when you're losing your mind a third of the way through the
exam and start panicking that you can't remember what an XMAS scan returns on a
closed port, you'll have a reference. And trust me, having it there makes it easier for you
to recall the information, even if you never look at it.</h3><br>
<h3> Trust your instincts. When you do question review, unless you absolutely, positively,
beyond any shadow of a doubt know you initially marked the wrong answer, do not
change it.</h3><br>
<h3> Take the questions at face value. I know many people who don't do well on exams
because they're trying to figure out what the test writer meant when putting the question
together. Don't read into a question; just answer it and move on.</h3><br>
<h3> Schedule your exam sooner than you think you'll be ready for it. I say this because I know
people who say, "I'm going to study for six months and then I'll be ready to take the
exam." Six months pass and they're still sitting there, studying and preparing. If you do
not put it on the calendar to make yourself prepare, you'll never take it, because you'll
never be ready.</h3><br>
