    <p><strong>What's Agile?</strong></p>
   <ol type="I">
    
      <li>Agile is a <i><strong>product development approach</strong></i> (it is not a methodology) and there is no single "Agile", as in the noun. It is a <i><strong>collection of values and principles</strong></i> about software development. Most importantly, it is a huge mistake to call it or think of it as a project management framework.  Also, Agilists frequently label every "non-Agile" approach as Waterfall.  This is a gross over-simplification and misinterpretation of project management frameworks, few of which have very much in common with Waterfall.
      Read carefully this <a href="http://pmsymposium.umd.edu/pm2018/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/01/Applying-1970-Waterfall-Lessons-Learned-with-Todays-Agile-Development-Process-JMorgan.pdf"
                             target="_blank">outstanding article</a> about William Winston Royce 1970 Waterfall development process. It's crucial for
          the understanding of what Dr. Royce actually wrote about software development management.
       </li>

<li>Agile software development comprises various approaches to software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customers/end users.</li>

<li>It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages flexible responses to change.</li>

<li>The term agile (sometimes written Agile) was popularized, in this context, by the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. The values and principles espoused in this manifesto were derived from and underpin a broad range of software development frameworks, including Scrum and Kanban.</li>

<li>While there is much anecdotal evidence that adopting agile practices and values improves the agility of software professionals, teams and organizations, some empirical studies have disputed that evidence.</li>

    <p><strong>History</strong></p>

<ol type="I">


<li>Iterative and incremental development methods can be traced back as early as 1957, with evolutionary project management and adaptive software development emerging in the early 1970s.</li>

<li>During the 1990s, a number of lightweight software development methods evolved in reaction to the prevailing heavyweight methods (such as waterfall) that critics described as overly regulated, planned, and micro-managed. These included: rapid application development (RAD), from 1991; the unified process (UP) and dynamic systems development method (DSDM), both from 1994; Scrum, from 1995; Crystal Clear and extreme programming (XP), both from 1996; and feature-driven development, from 1997. Although these all originated before the publication of the Agile Manifesto, they are now collectively referred to as agile software development methods. At the same time, similar changes were underway in manufacturing and aerospace.</li>

<li>In 2001, these seventeen software developers met at a resort in Snowbird, Utah to discuss these lightweight development methods: Kent Beck, Ward Cunningham, Dave Thomas, Jeff Sutherland, Ken Schwaber, Jim Highsmith, Alistair Cockburn, Robert C. Martin, Mike Beedle, Arie van Bennekum, Martin Fowler, James Grenning, Andrew Hunt, Ron Jeffries, Jon Kern, Brian Marick, and Steve Mellor. Together they published the Manifesto for Agile Software Development.</li>

<li>In 2005, a group headed by Cockburn and Highsmith wrote an addendum of project management principles, the PM Declaration of Interdependence, to guide software project management according to agile software development methods.</li>

<li>In 2009, a group working with Martin wrote an extension of software development principles, the Software Craftsmanship Manifesto, to guide agile software development according to professional conduct and mastery.</li>

<li>In 2011, the Agile Alliance created the Guide to Agile Practices (renamed the Agile Glossary in 2016), an evolving open-source compendium of the working definitions of agile practices, terms, and elements, along with interpretations and experience guidelines from the worldwide community of agile practitioners.</li>

 <p><strong>The Manifesto for Agile Software Development.</strong></p>


<p><u>Agile software development values.</u></p>


<p>Based on their combined experience of developing software and helping others do that, the seventeen signatories to the manifesto proclaimed that they value:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Individuals and interactions <i>over</i> processes and tools.</li>
    <li>Working software <i>over</i> comprehensive documentation.</li>
    <li>Customer collaboration <i>over</i> contract negotiation.</li>
    <li>Responding to change <i>over</i> following a plan.</li>
</ul>

<p>That is to say, the items on the left are valued <i>more</i> than the items on the right.</p>

<p>As Scott Ambler elucidated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tools and processes are important, but it is more important to have competent people working together effectively.</li>

<li>Good documentation is useful in helping people to understand how the software is built and how to use it, but the main point of development is to create software, not documentation.</li>

<li>A contract is important but is no substitute for working closely with customers to discover what they need.</li>

<li>A project plan is important, but it must not be too rigid to accommodate changes in technology or the environment, stakeholders' priorities, and people's understanding of the problem and its solution.</li>

<li>Some of the authors formed the Agile Alliance, a non-profit organization that promotes software development according to the manifesto's values and principles. </li>

</ul>


<p>Introducing the manifesto on behalf of the Agile Alliance, Jim Highsmith said:</p>

<p><i>The Agile movement is not anti-methodology, in fact many of us want to restore credibility to the word methodology. We want to restore a balance. We embrace modeling, but not in order to file some diagram in a dusty corporate repository. We embrace documentation, but not hundreds of pages of never-maintained and rarely-used tomes. We plan, but recognize the limits of planning in a turbulent environment. Those who would brand proponents of <strong>XP</strong> or <strong>SCRUM</strong> or any of the other Agile Methodologies as "hackers" are ignorant of both the methodologies and the original definition of the term hacker.</i></p>



<p><u>Agile software development principles.</u></p>

<p>The Manifesto for Agile Software Development is based on twelve principles:</p>

<ol>
<li>Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.</li>
<li>Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.</li>
<li>Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months).</li>
<li>Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers.</li>
<li>Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted.</li>
<li>Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location).</li>
<li>Working software is the primary measure of progress.</li>
<li>Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace.</li>
<li>Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design.</li>
<li>Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.</li>
<li>Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.</li>
<li>Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly.</li>
</ol>

 <p><strong>SCRUM.</strong></p>
     <p> 
     <strong>Scrum</strong> is an agile framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products, with an initial emphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields including research, sales, marketing and advanced technologies. It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members, who break their work into goals that can be completed within timeboxed iterations, called <strong>sprints</strong>, no longer than one month and most commonly <u>two weeks</u>. The Scrum Team track progress in 15-minute time-boxed daily meetings, called <b>daily scrums</b>. At the end of the sprint, the team holds sprint review, to demonstrate the work done, and sprint retrospective to continuously improve.

  <div class="container" style="height: 1000px;background-color: white;font-size: 36px">  
    <strong>XP</strong><br>

<p>Extreme programming (XP) is a software development methodology which is intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. As a type of agile software development, it advocates frequent "releases" in short development cycles, which is intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints at which new customer requirements can be adopted.</p>

<p>Other elements of extreme programming include: programming in pairs or doing extensive code review, unit testing of all code, not programming features until they are actually needed, a flat management structure, code simplicity and clarity, expecting changes in the customer's requirements as time passes and the problem is better understood, and frequent communication with the customer and among programmers. The methodology takes its name from the idea that the beneficial elements of traditional software engineering practices are taken to "extreme" levels. As an example, code reviews are considered a beneficial practice; taken to the extreme, code can be reviewed continuously, i.e. the practice of pair programming.</p>
