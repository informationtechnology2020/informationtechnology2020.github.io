    <div>
        <p>Value-Driven Delivery.</p>
        The concept of value-driven delivery manifests in every stage of an Agile
project - initiation where the business case of projects are justified, incremental planning where
customer values and risks are balanced and prioritized, monitoring and tracking with deliberate
emphasis on real-time customer feedback and reporting value through a variety of visual indicators.
    </div>
    

<h3>3.1	The Agile Triangle</h3>
    <div>
        <p>In traditional projects, there's the Traditional Iron Triangle: Scope, Time, Cost.</p>
       <p> In Agile, Quality, Value and Constraints (Cost, Schedule, Scope).</p>
    </div>

<h3>3.2	Embedding Value-Driven Delivery in Agile Practices.</h3>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li> Deliver value in increments.           </li>
             <li> Deliver value early.            </li>
             <li> Value-based analysis (to maximize the ROI).           </li>
             <li> Prioritizing Collaboratively.           </li>
             <li>  Minimizing non-value added work.          </li>
             <li>  Frequent review based on stakeholder priorities.          </li>
             <li>  Focus on quality.          </li>
             <li>  Focus on non-functional requirements (like security, privacy, compliance, usability, performance).         </li>
             <li>  Continuous improvement.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

<h3>3.3	Determining Value at Project Initiation.</h3>
    <div>
        Projects are typically authorized as a result of one or more of the following strategic considerations:
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li> Market demand or requests from customer segments.       </li>
            <li> Strategic opportunity to seek competitive advantage.       </li>
            <li> Improvement of operational efficiency.       </li>
            <li>  Technological advancement.      </li>
            <li> Legal and regulatory compliance requirements.       </li>
            <li>  Environmental consideration      </li>
            <li>  Social need or safety need.      </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

<h3>3.4	Cycle Time.</h3>
    <div>
        <p>Cycle time is defined as the average time it takes an item to get from the end of the queue
        to a state of being complete or done. The goal of Agile is to ensure that the cycle time be kept
        at a minimum.</p>
    </div>

<h3>3.5	Value Stream Mapping.</h3>
    <div>
        <p>Value stream mapping is a technique that has its origins in the Lean manufactury industry. It looks
        at value from the customer's perspective and delivers features in products and services. 
        </p>
        <p>
        It begins with a value stream map that sequences all the steps and processes that are required or not
            required to get value delivered to the customer. All non-value added activities are identified by
            the team and eliminated one by one.
        </p>
    </div>

<h3>3.6	Value-Based Prioritization Techniques.</h3>
    <div>
        <p>Work items are prioritized based on:</p>
        <ul>
<li> Business Value in terms of incremental or retained revenue and customer
satisfaction
</li><li> Legal, regulatory and compliance requirements
</li><li> Cost of implementation and ongoing maintenance
</li><li> Urgency and time sensitivity of the feature in the product
</li><li> Early adopters for a niche concept in the market
</li><li> Greatest return on investment (e.g., quick wins) and likelihood of success in
marketing the product
</li><li> Inherent riskiness of the feature
</li><li> Stakeholder consensus
</li><li> Usability and reusability
</li><li> Amount of knowledge or experience gathered about the domain, technology,
or the product</li>
</ul>
    </div>

<h3>3.7	Product Backlog.</h3>
    <div>
        <ul>

<li>The product backlog is one of the
key list of items that are yet to be implemented by the development team. </li>

<li>It can contain business
requirements expressed as  features or stories, defects, risks, or technical tasks identified by
the team. </li>

<li>It is not necessary that all items in the product backlog will be implemented or necessary
for shipping a working version of the product.</li>

<li> Only the ones that yield value (or mitigates risks) are
prioritized and delivered in the same priority order by the team. </li>

<li>Some items from the backlog could
even be simply discarded (so they never get implemented) based on very low priorities assigned to
them.</li>

<li> An example of such is a feature that is optionally required by a very small segment of users,
but something that is very expensive to build and so will not yield a good return on investment.</li>

</ul>
    </div>

<h3>3.8	Agile Metrics and KPIs.</h3>
    <div>
        <p>Some of the attributes of a good metric used in Agile projects are:</p>
<ul>
<li> It should be easy to collect such that the team does not spend too much time
gathering data.
</li><li> It should be based on real data, rather than estimated or mocked-up data.
</li><li> It should be visualized and put up in a common space where anyone can view it.

</li><li> It should be decided by the team, not imposed upon them.
</li><li> It should be dynamic and updated by anyone in the team, such that the team can feel
that they contribute toward the progress and are able to observe trends.
</li><li> It should not be used to appraise the team or an individual.
</li><li> It should be used to understand the dynamics at the workplace and stimulate
conversation on how to continuously improve the processes, tools and strategies.
</li><li> The team should be convinced that the effort and time spent in collecting metrics,
analyzing it and acting upon it does indeed add value to the business.</li>
</ul>
    </div>

<h3 class="text-center">Chapter 4.		Domain III: </h3>
    <div>
        <p>Stakeholder Engagement.</p>
        
<ul>

<li>Since projects
are commissioned for the benefit of stakeholders, stakeholder satisfaction is a key objective for the project
team.</li>

<li> Irrespective of whether the other project constraints are met or not, stakeholder (e.g., customer)
satisfaction or lack of it could translate into success or failure of a project. </li>

<li>The most dominating stakeholder
is the customer or the user of the software product being built by the Agile professionals</li>

<li>Engaging and managing stakeholders is not easy. To do this effectively, one needs a whole basket of soft
skills and leadership attributes in varying ratios and proportions based on the situation at hand.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

<h3>4.1	Understanding Stakeholder Needs.</h3>
    <div>
        <p>It is of vital importance that the Agile project team begins with identification of right (and
legitimate) stakeholders, understanding their needs, wants, wishes, dreams and priorities. Note
that stakeholder identification is not a one-off activity that is done in the initial days of the project,
but something that needs to be continuously monitored as the project moves along</p>
    </div>

<h3>4.2	Ensuring Stakeholder Involvement.</h3>
    <div>
       
 <p>One of the 12 Agile principles states: "Business people and developers must
work together daily throughout the project."  </p>

 <p>The principles promote a culture of participation and
collaboration between stakeholders of a project - all working toward the same goal to benefit the customers
by incremental delivery of valuable software increments. </p>


 <p>Having so far identified stakeholders and collected their requirements, it is necessary to keep them
involved and engaged as the project moves along.</p>
    </div>

<h3>4.3	Managing Stakeholders.</h3>
    <div>
        <p>Agile projects communication is more free flow, frequent
and continuous than that of traditional projects. </p>

<p>With an emphasis of business and teams being co-located and a series of ceremonies
(like planning, estimating, daily stand-ups, reviews and reflection workshops), Agile teams handle
communication between stakeholders more effectively. </p>

<p>In fact, with face-to-face communication, Agile
teams can afford to do barely sufficient documentation.</p>


    </div>

<h3>4.4	Interpersonal Skills for Managing Stakeholders.</h3>
    <div>
        


Emotional intelligence is a soft skill required in the toolbox of the Agile leader or coach to
acquire and apply knowledge from emotions of oneself and the team to effectively relate to
them and lead them toward success. <br>

 Coupled with negotiation and conflict management skills,
this skill helps in a wide variety of situations.<br>


<p>In other words emotional intelligence means the ability to: </p>
<ul> 
 <li>Identify and manage one’s self</li>
 <li>Understand one’s feeling and emotions</li>
 <li>Understand other’s feelings and emotions</li>
 <li>Respond to the situation appropriately</li>
    
    </ul>
    </div>

<h3>4.5	Agile Leadership Styles.</h3>
    <div>
       <table class="table table-striped table-bordered">

<th>Focus of an Agile leader</th><th> Focus of a project manager</th>

<tr><td>People-oriented - individuals and interactions </td><td>		Action-oriented – tasks and dependencies </td>

<h3 class="text-center">Chapter 5.		Domain IV: </h3>
    <div>
        <p>Team Performance.</p>
        <ol>

<li>An Agile team is self-empowered,
cross-functional, self-motivated, self-managed, self-organized, self-directed, self-correcting,
participative and collaborative.</li>


<li>This chapter shows what goes in forming such teams, keeping them
together, empowering them and exploiting synergies to achieve success. </li>

<li>A very important factor is the
communication within the team.</li>

</ol>
    </div>

<h3>5.1	Team Formation.</h3>
    <div>
        <ul>

<li>Getting like-minded team players together is like laying a foundation on which future pillars will be erected.</li>


<li>As Henry Ford stated:  "Coming together
is a beginning. Keeping together is progress. Working together is success." </li>

<li> Agile leaders recognize that
individuals are the ultimate source of value, and they strive hard to create an environment that boosts
performance, productivity and stimulates positivity. </li>

</ul>
    </div>

<h3>5.2	Team Empowerment.</h3>
    <div>
        
<p>Agile teams are empowered to take various decisions by collaborating with each other:</p>
<ol>

<li> Support the decision made by the product owner to determine what features should
go into a release.
</li><li> Determine, through consensus, the estimates and complexity of the work items.
</li><li> Set expectations around scope and schedule accordingly.
</li><li> Determine the length of an iteration.
</li><li> Determine the velocity of the team, that is, the capacity to deliver for each iteration.
</li><li> Determine what and how to report and inspect status on the information radiators.
</li><li> Own all aspects of quality and use problem solving techniques to resolve day-to-day
issues and remove impediments.
</li><li> Determine what tools and processes add value to them and tailor them based on the
situation at hand.
</li><li> Determine how to continuously improve themselves through self-introspection
during reflection workshops.</li>

</ol>

<p>To empower Agile teams, Agile leaders steer away from a command-and-control style into a servant
leadership style with the realization that empowerment breeds trust and individual commitment to the
project. </p>

<p>Agile leaders play an instrumental role in communicating (and recommunicating) the vision of the
organization and project, create a collaborative environment that fosters productivity and creativity, remove
blockers and impediments and encourage clear and transparent communication across stakeholders.</p>
    </div>

<h3>5.3	Team Collaboration and Commitment.</h3>
    <div>
        <ul>

<li>Once the teams are formed, the success of the team depends on how people resolve their differences, be
mindful of each other’s strengths and weaknesses, exploit synergies and focus on a shared goal. </li>


 <li>Several soft skills like active listening, negotiation techniques, conflict
resolution techniques, emotional intelligence and servant leadership that Agile team members and leaders
like coaches and Scrum Masters use for day-to-day interactions and coordination among each other.</li>

<li> All
these are relevant for team members to build trust, commitment, work cohesively toward
a shared goal and ultimately succeed. </li>

</ul>
    </div>

<h3>5.4	Communication in Agile Teams.</h3>
    <div>
        <p>Since there is less emphasis and dependence on detailed
documentation, communication plays a vital role between Agile project teams.</p>
        
        <ol>
<li>Face-to-face communication is the richest form of
communication and is a powerful tool to improve productivity and effectiveness in a team
environment.</li>

<li> In fact, we have also seen that one of the 12 Agile principles emphasizes face-to-face
communication: <i>"The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to
and within a development team is face-to-face conversation."</i>
</li>

</ol>
        
    </div>

<h3>5.5	Agile Contracting.</h3>
    <div>
        <ul>

<li>As the complexity of projects increase, organizations and project realize the value of specialized software
and services, some of which might be lacking within themselves.

<li> One option is to build the capability
internally, especially if confidential and proprietary data and processes are involved.

<li> But that could take
time and incur costs that may not be justifiable given the short-term needs required on the project. </li>

<li>Often the
chosen solution is to buy product and services from a vendor who specializes in them and use it only for the
period that is required. </li>

<li>Procuring services from the vendor could also help the organization transfer some
risks in trying to build something on their own, especially in a domain where they have limited knowledge or
capability.</li>


<li>The process of contracting involves planning, choosing a seller (or vendor), negotiating and creating the
contract and its terms and conditions, administering the same during the project life cycle (like reporting
and monitoring progress, checking acceptance criteria, auditing, approving invoices and making payments,
resolving disputes if any) and finally closing the contract once the project is over. </li>

<li>The contract is a legally
bound document between the buyer (also called client) and the seller (also called vendor) to deliver a
product or a service in lieu of money or something valuable.</li>


<li>The goal for negotiating a contract (also called a Statement of Work abbreviated as SOW) is to make the
terms and conditions fair and reasonable such that there is a win-win outcome. </li>

<li>Only when both parties are
focused on the mutual benefit obtained through the contract and feel that they are adequately protected by
the contractual clauses, can we expect trust, confidence, commitment and a sustainable partnership to
build up.</li>

</ul>
    </div>

<h3>5.6	Agile PMO.</h3>
    <div>
        <ul>

<li> In traditional projects the Project Management Office is a department that centrally supports
and guides project managers by introducing, training, maintaining and controlling a consistent and
standard set of processes, practices, tools, techniques and templates relevant to project management.</li>


<li>In Agile projects, the functions of a classic project manager are distributed between the
product owner, Scrum Master and the whole team. </li>


<li>In doing so, it seems that the role of the PMO is
either diminished or absent in an Agile team. However, in reality, the role of the PMO shifts from a
controlling and policing style to that of a supporting, advisory and consultative function.</li>

</ul>
    </div>

<h3 class="text-center">Chapter 6.		Domain V: </h3>
    <div>
        <p>Adaptive Planning.</p>
    </div>

<h3>6.1	Aspects of Agile Planning.</h3>
    <div>
        <ul>
<li> Planning based on priority and business value realized.
</li><li> Deferring detailed planning until the last responsible moment.
</li><li> Planning for only value-added features that are pulled by the customer and no
extras.
</li><li> Planning not in stages of SDLC, but such that all necessary activities are completed
within the agreed timebox.
</li><li> Planning with the help of dedicated teams who are not multitasking.
</li><li> Planning as one whole team, so as to break the silos between role families like
architects, designers, product management, developers and testers.
</li><li> Planning adaptively so as to cater for change and uncertainty on the fly.
</li><li> Religiously inspect and adapt the plan continuously based on feedback and
retrospectives.</li>
</ul>
    </div>

<h3>6.2	User Stories.</h3>
    <div>
        <ul>

<li>User stories are a fundamental concept in Agile methods. </li>

<li>User stories describe requirements
or functionalities of the software from a user’s perspective. </li>

<li>Such stories are written in a simple
manner, free from technical details or jargons and captures the essence of who (the role), what
(the feature description) and why (rationale / benefit) of the requirement.</li>

<li> Agile practitioners write
user stories on small cards or persist them on electronic systems (like Jira) and use them to trigger
conversations to discover details of the business needs and how the software should be estimated,
designed, developed and tested.</li>


<li>User stories can be used to represent a new feature, an enhancement to an existing feature,
technical task (like a nonfunctional requirement), or a defect unearthed during testing. </li>

<li>Once the
stories are identified and prioritized in collaboration with the customers, developers estimate them
and then slot them into one of the iterations for implementation. </li>

<li>Once developed, the acceptance
tests are executed to verify that the stories work exactly the way the customer expected it to be.</li>

</ul>
    </div>

<h3>6.3	Agile Estimation.</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
        Like traditional projects, estimation in an Agile project is a valuable aspect that is used to gauge the
commercial value (financially, in terms of return on investment) and feasibility (e.g., in terms of schedule,
when and how much of a benefit that can be realized, competition or regulatory time constraints) of a
project. 
        </p><p>
With the help of these estimates, project sponsors and senior leadership can make a decision
whether to approve a project, whether to keep a project going if it’s already underway, whether to perform
any course correction or choose what features to release in which iteration.
        </p>
    </div>

<h3>6.4	Velocity.</h3>
    <div>
        <p>Velocity is a very important metric in determining the progress of an Agile project.</p><p> Originating
from the time and distance theory in physics, it is used to measure how much the team
        accomplished during a particular interval. </p><p>The interval is generally chosen as the sprint or
iteration duration and the progress as the amount of stories accomplished.</p>
    </div>

<h3>6.5	Release Planning.</h3>
    <div>
        <p>The release plan is generally outlined by the product owner. </p>

<p>He uses the release plan to
provide visibility to all stakeholders by giving them what to be expected when.</p>

 <p>At a high level the
product owner could base the release plan on a few circumstances prevailing in the project and its
environment, like:</p>

<ul>

<li> Regulatory constraints that the product and the organization needs to comply with,
</li><li> Gaining competitive advantage in the market place,
</li><li> Contractual obligations to meet a particular milestone,
</li><li> Passing on benefits to the customer,
</li><li> Exploiting opportunities to test incremental versions of the product (e.g., beta testing
of some features),
</li><li> Avoid losses or penalties for not delivering a predetermined scope at a particular
time.</li>
