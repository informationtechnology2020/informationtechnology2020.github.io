    <div>
        <p>Value-Driven Delivery.</p>
        The concept of value-driven delivery manifests in every stage of an Agile
project - initiation where the business case of projects are justified, incremental planning where
customer values and risks are balanced and prioritized, monitoring and tracking with deliberate
emphasis on real-time customer feedback and reporting value through a variety of visual indicators.
    </div>
    

<h3>3.1	The Agile Triangle</h3>
    <div>
        <p>In traditional projects, there's the Traditional Iron Triangle: Scope, Time, Cost.</p>
       <p> In Agile, Quality, Value and Constraints (Cost, Schedule, Scope).</p>
    </div>

<h3>3.2	Embedding Value-Driven Delivery in Agile Practices.</h3>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li> Deliver value in increments.           </li>
             <li> Deliver value early.            </li>
             <li> Value-based analysis (to maximize the ROI).           </li>
             <li> Prioritizing Collaboratively.           </li>
             <li>  Minimizing non-value added work.          </li>
             <li>  Frequent review based on stakeholder priorities.          </li>
             <li>  Focus on quality.          </li>
             <li>  Focus on non-functional requirements (like security, privacy, compliance, usability, performance).         </li>
             <li>  Continuous improvement.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

<h3>3.3	Determining Value at Project Initiation.</h3>
    <div>
        Projects are typically authorized as a result of one or more of the following strategic considerations:
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li> Market demand or requests from customer segments.       </li>
            <li> Strategic opportunity to seek competitive advantage.       </li>
            <li> Improvement of operational efficiency.       </li>
            <li>  Technological advancement.      </li>
            <li> Legal and regulatory compliance requirements.       </li>
            <li>  Environmental consideration      </li>
            <li>  Social need or safety need.      </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

<h3>3.4	Cycle Time.</h3>
    <div>
        <p>Cycle time is defined as the average time it takes an item to get from the end of the queue
        to a state of being complete or done. The goal of Agile is to ensure that the cycle time be kept
        at a minimum.</p>
    </div>

<h3>3.5	Value Stream Mapping.</h3>
    <div>
        <p>Value stream mapping is a technique that has its origins in the Lean manufactury industry. It looks
        at value from the customer's perspective and delivers features in products and services. 
        </p>
        <p>
        It begins with a value stream map that sequences all the steps and processes that are required or not
            required to get value delivered to the customer. All non-value added activities are identified by
            the team and eliminated one by one.
        </p>
    </div>

<h3>3.6	Value-Based Prioritization Techniques.</h3>
    <div>
        <p>Work items are prioritized based on:</p>
        <ul>
<li> Business Value in terms of incremental or retained revenue and customer
satisfaction
</li><li> Legal, regulatory and compliance requirements
</li><li> Cost of implementation and ongoing maintenance
</li><li> Urgency and time sensitivity of the feature in the product
</li><li> Early adopters for a niche concept in the market
</li><li> Greatest return on investment (e.g., quick wins) and likelihood of success in
marketing the product
</li><li> Inherent riskiness of the feature
</li><li> Stakeholder consensus
</li><li> Usability and reusability
</li><li> Amount of knowledge or experience gathered about the domain, technology,
or the product</li>
</ul>
    </div>

<h3>3.7	Product Backlog.</h3>
    <div>
        <ul>

<li>The product backlog is one of the
key list of items that are yet to be implemented by the development team. </li>

<li>It can contain business
requirements expressed as  features or stories, defects, risks, or technical tasks identified by
the team. </li>

<li>It is not necessary that all items in the product backlog will be implemented or necessary
for shipping a working version of the product.</li>

<li> Only the ones that yield value (or mitigates risks) are
prioritized and delivered in the same priority order by the team. </li>

<li>Some items from the backlog could
even be simply discarded (so they never get implemented) based on very low priorities assigned to
them.</li>

<li> An example of such is a feature that is optionally required by a very small segment of users,
but something that is very expensive to build and so will not yield a good return on investment.</li>

</ul>
    </div>

<h3>3.8	Agile Metrics and KPIs.</h3>
    <div>
        <p>Some of the attributes of a good metric used in Agile projects are:</p>
<ul>
<li> It should be easy to collect such that the team does not spend too much time
gathering data.
</li><li> It should be based on real data, rather than estimated or mocked-up data.
</li><li> It should be visualized and put up in a common space where anyone can view it.

</li><li> It should be decided by the team, not imposed upon them.
</li><li> It should be dynamic and updated by anyone in the team, such that the team can feel
that they contribute toward the progress and are able to observe trends.
</li><li> It should not be used to appraise the team or an individual.
</li><li> It should be used to understand the dynamics at the workplace and stimulate
conversation on how to continuously improve the processes, tools and strategies.
</li><li> The team should be convinced that the effort and time spent in collecting metrics,
analyzing it and acting upon it does indeed add value to the business.</li>
</ul>
    </div>

<h3 class="text-center">Chapter 4.		Domain III: </h3>
    <div>
        <p>Stakeholder Engagement.</p>
        
<ul>

<li>Since projects
are commissioned for the benefit of stakeholders, stakeholder satisfaction is a key objective for the project
team.</li>

<li> Irrespective of whether the other project constraints are met or not, stakeholder (e.g., customer)
satisfaction or lack of it could translate into success or failure of a project. </li>

<li>The most dominating stakeholder
is the customer or the user of the software product being built by the Agile professionals</li>

<li>Engaging and managing stakeholders is not easy. To do this effectively, one needs a whole basket of soft
skills and leadership attributes in varying ratios and proportions based on the situation at hand.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

<h3>4.1	Understanding Stakeholder Needs.</h3>
    <div>
        <p>It is of vital importance that the Agile project team begins with identification of right (and
legitimate) stakeholders, understanding their needs, wants, wishes, dreams and priorities. Note
that stakeholder identification is not a one-off activity that is done in the initial days of the project,
but something that needs to be continuously monitored as the project moves along</p>
    </div>

<h3>4.2	Ensuring Stakeholder Involvement.</h3>
    <div>
       
 <p>One of the 12 Agile principles states: "Business people and developers must
work together daily throughout the project."  </p>

 <p>The principles promote a culture of participation and
collaboration between stakeholders of a project - all working toward the same goal to benefit the customers
by incremental delivery of valuable software increments. </p>


 <p>Having so far identified stakeholders and collected their requirements, it is necessary to keep them
involved and engaged as the project moves along.</p>
    </div>

<h3>4.3	Managing Stakeholders.</h3>
    <div>
        <p>Agile projects communication is more free flow, frequent
and continuous than that of traditional projects. </p>

<p>With an emphasis of business and teams being co-located and a series of ceremonies
(like planning, estimating, daily stand-ups, reviews and reflection workshops), Agile teams handle
communication between stakeholders more effectively. </p>

<p>In fact, with face-to-face communication, Agile
teams can afford to do barely sufficient documentation.</p>


    </div>

<h3>4.4	Interpersonal Skills for Managing Stakeholders.</h3>
    <div>
        


Emotional intelligence is a soft skill required in the toolbox of the Agile leader or coach to
acquire and apply knowledge from emotions of oneself and the team to effectively relate to
them and lead them toward success. <br>

 Coupled with negotiation and conflict management skills,
this skill helps in a wide variety of situations.<br>


<p>In other words emotional intelligence means the ability to: </p>
<ul> 
 <li>Identify and manage one’s self</li>
 <li>Understand one’s feeling and emotions</li>
 <li>Understand other’s feelings and emotions</li>
 <li>Respond to the situation appropriately</li>
    
    </ul>
    </div>

<h3>4.5	Agile Leadership Styles.</h3>
    <div>
       <table class="table table-striped table-bordered">

<th>Focus of an Agile leader</th><th> Focus of a project manager</th>

<tr><td>People-oriented - individuals and interactions </td><td>		Action-oriented – tasks and dependencies </td>

<h3 class="text-center">Chapter 5.		Domain IV: </h3>
    <div>
        <p>Team Performance.</p>
        <ol>

<li>An Agile team is self-empowered,
cross-functional, self-motivated, self-managed, self-organized, self-directed, self-correcting,
participative and collaborative.</li>


<li>This chapter shows what goes in forming such teams, keeping them
together, empowering them and exploiting synergies to achieve success. </li>

<li>A very important factor is the
communication within the team.</li>

</ol>
    </div>

<h3>5.1	Team Formation.</h3>
    <div>
        <ul>

<li>Getting like-minded team players together is like laying a foundation on which future pillars will be erected.</li>


<li>As Henry Ford stated:  "Coming together
is a beginning. Keeping together is progress. Working together is success." </li>

<li> Agile leaders recognize that
individuals are the ultimate source of value, and they strive hard to create an environment that boosts
performance, productivity and stimulates positivity. </li>

</ul>
    </div>

<h3>5.2	Team Empowerment.</h3>
    <div>
        
<p>Agile teams are empowered to take various decisions by collaborating with each other:</p>
<ol>

<li> Support the decision made by the product owner to determine what features should
go into a release.
</li><li> Determine, through consensus, the estimates and complexity of the work items.
</li><li> Set expectations around scope and schedule accordingly.
</li><li> Determine the length of an iteration.
</li><li> Determine the velocity of the team, that is, the capacity to deliver for each iteration.
</li><li> Determine what and how to report and inspect status on the information radiators.
</li><li> Own all aspects of quality and use problem solving techniques to resolve day-to-day
issues and remove impediments.
</li><li> Determine what tools and processes add value to them and tailor them based on the
situation at hand.
</li><li> Determine how to continuously improve themselves through self-introspection
during reflection workshops.</li>

</ol>

<p>To empower Agile teams, Agile leaders steer away from a command-and-control style into a servant
leadership style with the realization that empowerment breeds trust and individual commitment to the
project. </p>

<p>Agile leaders play an instrumental role in communicating (and recommunicating) the vision of the
organization and project, create a collaborative environment that fosters productivity and creativity, remove
blockers and impediments and encourage clear and transparent communication across stakeholders.</p>
    </div>

<h3>5.3	Team Collaboration and Commitment.</h3>
    <div>
        <ul>

<li>Once the teams are formed, the success of the team depends on how people resolve their differences, be
mindful of each other’s strengths and weaknesses, exploit synergies and focus on a shared goal. </li>


 <li>Several soft skills like active listening, negotiation techniques, conflict
resolution techniques, emotional intelligence and servant leadership that Agile team members and leaders
like coaches and Scrum Masters use for day-to-day interactions and coordination among each other.</li>

<li> All
these are relevant for team members to build trust, commitment, work cohesively toward
a shared goal and ultimately succeed. </li>

</ul>
    </div>

<h3>5.4	Communication in Agile Teams.</h3>
    <div>
        <p>Since there is less emphasis and dependence on detailed
documentation, communication plays a vital role between Agile project teams.</p>
        
        <ol>
<li>Face-to-face communication is the richest form of
communication and is a powerful tool to improve productivity and effectiveness in a team
environment.</li>

<li> In fact, we have also seen that one of the 12 Agile principles emphasizes face-to-face
communication: <i>"The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to
and within a development team is face-to-face conversation."</i>
</li>

</ol>
        
    </div>

<h3>5.5	Agile Contracting.</h3>
    <div>
        <ul>

<li>As the complexity of projects increase, organizations and project realize the value of specialized software
and services, some of which might be lacking within themselves.

<li> One option is to build the capability
internally, especially if confidential and proprietary data and processes are involved.

<li> But that could take
time and incur costs that may not be justifiable given the short-term needs required on the project. </li>

<li>Often the
chosen solution is to buy product and services from a vendor who specializes in them and use it only for the
period that is required. </li>

<li>Procuring services from the vendor could also help the organization transfer some
risks in trying to build something on their own, especially in a domain where they have limited knowledge or
capability.</li>


<li>The process of contracting involves planning, choosing a seller (or vendor), negotiating and creating the
contract and its terms and conditions, administering the same during the project life cycle (like reporting
and monitoring progress, checking acceptance criteria, auditing, approving invoices and making payments,
resolving disputes if any) and finally closing the contract once the project is over. </li>

<li>The contract is a legally
bound document between the buyer (also called client) and the seller (also called vendor) to deliver a
product or a service in lieu of money or something valuable.</li>


<li>The goal for negotiating a contract (also called a Statement of Work abbreviated as SOW) is to make the
terms and conditions fair and reasonable such that there is a win-win outcome. </li>

<li>Only when both parties are
focused on the mutual benefit obtained through the contract and feel that they are adequately protected by
the contractual clauses, can we expect trust, confidence, commitment and a sustainable partnership to
build up.</li>

</ul>
    </div>

<h3>5.6	Agile PMO.</h3>
    <div>
        <ul>

<li> In traditional projects the Project Management Office is a department that centrally supports
and guides project managers by introducing, training, maintaining and controlling a consistent and
standard set of processes, practices, tools, techniques and templates relevant to project management.</li>


<li>In Agile projects, the functions of a classic project manager are distributed between the
product owner, Scrum Master and the whole team. </li>


<li>In doing so, it seems that the role of the PMO is
either diminished or absent in an Agile team. However, in reality, the role of the PMO shifts from a
controlling and policing style to that of a supporting, advisory and consultative function.</li>

</ul>
    </div>

<h3 class="text-center">Chapter 6.		Domain V: </h3>
    <div>
        <p>Adaptive Planning.</p>
    </div>

<h3>6.1	Aspects of Agile Planning.</h3>
    <div>
        <ul>
<li> Planning based on priority and business value realized.
</li><li> Deferring detailed planning until the last responsible moment.
</li><li> Planning for only value-added features that are pulled by the customer and no
extras.
</li><li> Planning not in stages of SDLC, but such that all necessary activities are completed
within the agreed timebox.
</li><li> Planning with the help of dedicated teams who are not multitasking.
</li><li> Planning as one whole team, so as to break the silos between role families like
architects, designers, product management, developers and testers.
</li><li> Planning adaptively so as to cater for change and uncertainty on the fly.
</li><li> Religiously inspect and adapt the plan continuously based on feedback and
retrospectives.</li>
</ul>
    </div>

<h3>6.2	User Stories.</h3>
    <div>
        <ul>

<li>User stories are a fundamental concept in Agile methods. </li>

<li>User stories describe requirements
or functionalities of the software from a user’s perspective. </li>

<li>Such stories are written in a simple
manner, free from technical details or jargons and captures the essence of who (the role), what
(the feature description) and why (rationale / benefit) of the requirement.</li>

<li> Agile practitioners write
user stories on small cards or persist them on electronic systems (like Jira) and use them to trigger
conversations to discover details of the business needs and how the software should be estimated,
designed, developed and tested.</li>


<li>User stories can be used to represent a new feature, an enhancement to an existing feature,
technical task (like a nonfunctional requirement), or a defect unearthed during testing. </li>

<li>Once the
stories are identified and prioritized in collaboration with the customers, developers estimate them
and then slot them into one of the iterations for implementation. </li>

<li>Once developed, the acceptance
tests are executed to verify that the stories work exactly the way the customer expected it to be.</li>

</ul>
    </div>

<h3>6.3	Agile Estimation.</h3>
    <div>
        <p>
        Like traditional projects, estimation in an Agile project is a valuable aspect that is used to gauge the
commercial value (financially, in terms of return on investment) and feasibility (e.g., in terms of schedule,
when and how much of a benefit that can be realized, competition or regulatory time constraints) of a
project. 
        </p><p>
With the help of these estimates, project sponsors and senior leadership can make a decision
whether to approve a project, whether to keep a project going if it’s already underway, whether to perform
any course correction or choose what features to release in which iteration.
        </p>
    </div>

<h3>6.4	Velocity.</h3>
    <div>
        <p>Velocity is a very important metric in determining the progress of an Agile project.</p><p> Originating
from the time and distance theory in physics, it is used to measure how much the team
        accomplished during a particular interval. </p><p>The interval is generally chosen as the sprint or
iteration duration and the progress as the amount of stories accomplished.</p>
    </div>

<h3>6.5	Release Planning.</h3>
    <div>
        <p>The release plan is generally outlined by the product owner. </p>

<p>He uses the release plan to
provide visibility to all stakeholders by giving them what to be expected when.</p>

 <p>At a high level the
product owner could base the release plan on a few circumstances prevailing in the project and its
environment, like:</p>

<ul>

<li> Regulatory constraints that the product and the organization needs to comply with,
</li><li> Gaining competitive advantage in the market place,
</li><li> Contractual obligations to meet a particular milestone,
</li><li> Passing on benefits to the customer,
</li><li> Exploiting opportunities to test incremental versions of the product (e.g., beta testing
of some features),
</li><li> Avoid losses or penalties for not delivering a predetermined scope at a particular
time.</li>

</ul>
    </div>

<h3 class="text-center">Chapter 7.		Domain VI: </h3>
    <div>
        <p>Problem Detection and Resolution.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Agile teams are self-organized. At the beginning of every iteration, they collectively commit to deliver
a certain scope within the timebox based on their capacity. However, even with the best of intentions,
surprises do crop up in projects. A characteristics of self-organization involves dealing with problems,
identifying them proactively and responding appropriately by taking either preventive or corrective
actions.</p>
    </div>

<h3>7.1	Risk  Management.</h3>
    <div>
        <ul>
<li>In traditional project management, risk management is dealt separately in conjunction with the project
plan.</li>

<li> As per PMBOK, risk management is a separate knowledge area that is pursued by project managers
to protect the value of the project and maintain the balance between scope, time, cost, quality and customer
satisfaction. 
Risks are traditionally identified, logged and tracked on a risk register and reported at periodic
intervals.</li>

<li>While the theory of risk management is mostly the same in Agile projects, the important point is that
risk management is a continuous activity in Agile project execution and receives a significant amount of
focus during each of the ceremonies or events. </li>

<li>Instead of a separate knowledge area, in Agile projects,
the risk management aspects is well integrated with planning, prioritization and execution cycles. </li>

<li>Agile
projects  balance both value and risks. The culture
of iterative delivery and frequent reflections in Agile projects not only help in identifying or detecting risks
early, but also plan potential responses in the event of the risks happening well in advance.</li>
<li> This is extremely
helpful, as otherwise, the risks and issues get carried over to the later phases of the project (e.g., during a
cumbersome integration or end-to-end testing stages) where the cost of change escalates exponentially.</li>
</ul>
    </div>

<h3>7.2	Quality Control Practices in Agile.</h3>
    <div>
        <ul>

<li>Quality is embedded in all disciplines of Agile.</li>

<li> It is well understood
how the cost of defect removal increases exponentially if they happen to be detected late in the life cycle of the
project.</li>

<li> Not only does complexity increase because more and more code is built on top of the bug, but also fixing
a defect needs a prolonged and complex regression cycle because the change impacts many systems, modules,
components and data as well as stakeholders who are already using them. </li>

<li>Agile teams are attentive to quality
upfront and within their practices they embed the principles of prevention, early detection, containment and
early resolution of problems and defects.</li>

</ul>
    </div>

<h3>7.3	Problem Resolution.</h3>
    <div>
        <ul>

<li>Problems are best tackled by the team members themselves, as they are the ones who are
closest to the ground level and have the maximum amount of information required to diagnose
the root cause of the problem and come up with options to resolve them. </li>

<li>Agile leaders like
coaches and Scrum Masters have an important role to play. They should not try to intervene and
mediate;instead they should empower the Agile team, remind them of the values, principles
and the vision; and encourage them to take ownership and solve the problems on their own. </li>

<li>Of
course, if there are impediments that are raised beyond their remit, it will need the Agile leaders
to step in directly and resolve it through facilitation, influencing, conflict management and
negotiation skills.</li>


<li>Daily stand-up meetings are an important forum for the team members to come forward and
share their problems openly. However, the meeting itself should not be used for problem solving,
as most problems will need a good amount of thinking and evaluation that should be taken offline.</li>

<li>The ultimate goal of any software product is to meet the needs of the business and yet remain commercially
viable to maintain. </li>

<li>Over a length of time we expect to see customers' needs evolve and that should be reflected
in features of the product. </li>

<li>One of the most important artifacts is the product roadmap that captures the journey of evolution of
the software product through its life as it keeps pace with customer needs and technology advancements.</li>

</ul>

<h3>8.2	Process Improvement.</h3>
    <div>
        <ul>
<li>A lot of focus in Agile projects goes into visualizing progress (through Kanban boards, burndown
charts and other information radiators) that exposes opportunities for the team to improve
their way of working.</li>

<li>Note that a process-compliant team may not guarantee success of a product, but a structured
process helps maintain consistency, predictability and align to organizational requirements.</li>

<li>However, none of the Agile practices are rigid as far as process-compliance goes. In fact, Agile
teams choose what best suits their unique situation and context and ensure that consistency,
efficiency and effectiveness is maintained. </li>

<li>Like products, processes also go through their
evolution and maturity cycles.</li>

</ul>
    </div>

<h3>8.3	Retrospectives.</h3>
    <div>
       <ul>
<li>Retrospectives, arguably, are one of the most powerful techniques in the toolbox of the Agile
professional.
 From the PMI-ACP exam perspective, too, this is the most important section of this
chapter. You can almost always expect a bunch of questions around retrospectives.</li>

<li>Retrospectives, also sometimes referred as reflection workshops, are forums for Agile teams to
look back, reflect and evaluate the performance of their processes at the end of each iteration. In
Agile methods like Kanban where there are no iterations, teams could be running retrospectives at
predefined intervals like once in 2 weeks or so, timeboxing it to an hour or two.</li>

<li>During a retrospective, the team members collectively reflect on what went well and what needs
to change. Based on this,adaptive actions are committed and implemented from the next iteration
itself. </li>

<li>The goal of a retrospective is to improve efficiency, eliminate wasteful activities and bad practices
(also called Agile smells), increase productivity, quality and team learning. This is a hallmark of the
philosophy of continuous process improvement. </li>

<li>The outcomes of retrospectives are often displayed
on flipcharts or information radiators to remind team members of their commitment to improve.</li>

<li>It is important that the discussion is healthy and constructive and there is no blame game
or finger-pointing if things did not go as well as expected. The participants in the retrospective
should acknowledge and believe that the team honestly achieved what they could do best given
the information in hand and the constraints in the environment.</li>

</ul>
    </div>

<h3>8.4	People.</h3>
    <div>
        <ul>

Agile practices are characterized by rapid feedback loops at various stages. Here are some key aspects on
giving feedback to people:
<hr>
<li> Make the feedback constructive in nature. The person receiving the feedback should
be receptive and feel comfortable that the feedback and suggestions are being given
for their improvement.
</li><li> Positive feedback is easy to communicate. But negative feedback should be carefully
delivered, otherwise it can get misconstrued very easily. One prevalent technique is
the 'sandwich method' where the corrective feedback is sandwiched between layers
of praise. The goal is not to sugar-coat, but to make it easier to deliver and accept, as
the recipient feels that the feedback is well rounded.
</li><li> Make the feedback relevant and related to the overall goals and objectives of the
individual and that of the project.
</li><li> Exhibit care as it is important that the feedback contains proper choice of words
and body language. Use of negative words and judgment could have a discouraging
effect.
</li><li> Be specific, back up with sufficient data and give instances of observations and
examples as that is how the receiver and the feedback giver can connect better.
</li><li> Praise in public, but criticize in private - human beings feel good receiving
admiration in public, but negative comments in public hurt them more deeply. A
private space is the best spot to deliver corrective feedback.
</li><li> Give the feedback at the appropriate time such that the issue can be addressed
promptly. Waiting too late could have a detrimental effect on the consequences.
</li><li> Let the feedback be regular. Especially in the team environment, it is helpful to have
one-on-one sessions at least once every 2 weeks. Feedback twice a year during the
midyear and annual performance cycles, could some with surprise, making them
seldom effective.
</li><li> Followup after some time to see if the feedback has been actioned or not.</li>

</ul>

<h3>8.5 	Agile Adoption.</h3>
    <div>
        <ul>

<li>Although many organizations understand the benefits of following Agile like higher return on investment,
efficiency and customer-oriented behavior, transition into Agile is not easy. </li>

<li>There could be situations where
the top management has an intense desire to transform the way value is delivered to the customer and they
see Agile and devops a means of realizing their vision. </li>

<li>But, on the ground there could be lots of resistive
forces - legacy software, documentation-heavy processes, silos in the organization and mindsets of people.</li>


<li>The bigger the organization the more intertwined are its processes.</li>
